    "description": "In the grim and unyielding void of a shattered age, you are cast into a forsaken system of scientific epochs—where progress is not earned, but extracted through suffering and steel. A vast litany of obscure, arcane materials demands fealty, forged in the fires of combustion and hardened in the silence of computation. Advancement is not a choice—it is survival.\n\nBeyond the golden gaze of the sun lies Gaia, a world of impossible beauty and treacherous calm. It whispers of paradise, of verdant plains and crystalline skies—but its silence is a lie. Beneath the surface, a dead empire festers—its crystalline bones laced with power, its ruins baiting the arrogant and the desperate alike. It is not a gift. It is a test.\n\nThis is no garden of the gods. This is a machine—divine in scale, merciless in function. A grand edifice built not to uplift, but to raise the chosen high enough to defy the stars, and fall screaming into the abyss. Only the relentless, the iron-willed, and the mad shall find purpose in this cosmic crucible.\n\nThis is Exotic Industries. And there is no going back.",
