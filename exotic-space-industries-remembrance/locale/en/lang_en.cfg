[entity-description]
ei-exotic-assembler=Where conventional fabricators arrange atoms by rote, the Exotic Assembler bends matter into configurations that should not exist. By channeling the same quantum-plasma principles that power heavy weaponry, it forges relic-tier components: alloys beyond metallurgy, circuits laced with vacuum resonance, artifacts whose very geometries hum with forbidden symmetry.\nThe Assembler’s core reaction chamber is [color=red]violently unstable[/color], each quantum collapse threatening to bloom into a detonation rivaling its own creations. Only by surrounding it with [color=purple]Matter Stabilizers[/color]—a lattice of gravitational dampers and entropic siphons—can its volatility be barely constrained.
ei-plasma-turret=A relic-grade weapon platform engineered to harness the volatile elegance of contained starfire. Instead of crude projectiles, the turret channels plasma through quantum-stabilized coils, condensing raw stellar energy into a dense orb of violet brilliance.
ei-high-temperature-reactor=Beyond the threshold of conventional energy, the High-Temperature Reactor stands as a crucible of raw power and relentless flux. Drawing its infernal breath from an external nuclear reactor, it channels external heat with surgical precision into its molten heart. Within this blazing forge, an inserted fissile fuel rod ignites a symphony of atomic dance, multiplying thermal output into torrents of superheated lead coolant.
ei-beacon=Once the pinnacle of synchronized field projection, this beacon model now staggers beneath the weight of its own legacy. Its emission lattice is coarse, its phase harmonics outmoded—yet it endures, still pulsing signal into a world that no longer listens.\nConstructed in an era when throughput was god and resonance was brute-forced, it now functions more as artifact than instrument. Its core struggles to maintain coherence, barely skimming regulatory thresholds before collapse.\nStill, it counts. It *remembers*. And in the tally of overload, its burden is tallied all the same.\n[color=gray]“Ghosts of efficiency haunt even the rusted scaffold.”[/color]\nCounts as [color=orange]1[/color] beacon toward overloads.
ei-mechanical-inserter=Moves with the grace of a wind-up god. No wires. Just will.\nSprung from simple genius—rotates forever if you don't question the math.
ei-mechanical-long-inserter=Long arm of thermodynamic denial. It's not magic—it’s balance.\nCarries across distances with polite defiance of entropy.
zeus-wrath-zeus-turret_alt=Anchored to no land and sworn to no god, the Poseidon Installation channels the forgotten charge beneath all oceans. It calls down skyfire from orbit—judgment rendered through the air, not by it. Once placed, it does not guard—it [font=default-bold]warns[/font] the world: a storm is watching.
ei-cargo-bot=Monumental. Stoic. Carries the spine of the factory.\nMoves like it was never meant to stop.
ei-construction-bot=Precise. Kinetic. Hits the build site before the signal decays.\nIt doesn’t build—it pierces reality with structure.
ei-advanced-logistic-bot=Silent. Far-reaching. Faster than thought.\nIt crosses distances you didn’t know existed—and returns with payload.
ei-advanced-construction-bot=Not a builder—a memory engine.\nDesigns are not constructed. They are remembered into existence.
nuclear-reactor=Uses uranium fuel rods or fuel cells to generate heat. The heat output does NOT increase when built next to other reactors.
ei-crystal-accumulator=The crystal radiates energy. Seems to be unstable for long periods of time, mining it will result in a broken device. 
ei-crystal-accumulator-gaia=The crystal radiates energy. Seems to be stable for long periods of time.

[fluid-description]
ei-computing-power-chemical=Data gathered from simulations destabilized by the residue’s interaction with observer perception. It’s not just chaos—it’s subjective contradiction encoded in semiotic waveforms. Useful in modeling minds that no longer require material anchors.
ei-computing-power-organic=The data is scraped from dying biospheres, real or fabricated, collapsing under the weight of recursive life-death loops. Every cycle produces entropy-mirroring outputs useful for extreme planetary modeling and post-biological terraformation logic.
ei-computing-power-stone=The simulator extracts value by suffering the ore’s refusal to behave. Results include simulations of warped density, reversed inertial flow, and impossible object trajectories—crucial for FTL barrier modeling and pre-big-bang physics prototypes.
ei-computing-power-uranium=When simulated, the ghost-shell injects death-phase cosmology into the environment—producing data from disintegrating star cores, failed entropy inversions, and timelines where the universe folds in on itself prematurely.
ei-computing-power-petrified=Extracted from paradoxes under strain. The fossil’s presence forces simulations to fold over past iterations, producing recursive error vectors. The output is a high-fidelity composite of all failed futures—and their collapse signatures. Useful for forecasting collapse or engineering stable paradoxes.
ei-computing-power-scrap=Contains false transmissions from unreachable futures, alternate timelines, or fully dead civilizations. The simulation can’t parse them without breaking. The errors themselves become raw data—quantifiable in chaotic bit-collapse. Essential for weaponizing information theory.

[technology-description]
ei-high-tech-parts=Forged only within the [color=red]volatile core[/color] of the [color=blue]Exotic Assembler[/color][item=ei-exotic-assembler], these components are impossible to replicate elsewhere. Their structures defy classical physics—quantum-anchored alloys, probability-conducting filaments, and resonant cores that hum with subatomic harmony.\nDangerous to create but indispensable for relic-tier technology, High-Tech Parts are the keystones that push civilization beyond its limits.
ei-exotic-assembler=Where conventional fabricators arrange atoms by rote, the Exotic Assembler bends matter into configurations that should not exist. By channeling the same quantum-plasma principles that power heavy weaponry, it forges relic-tier components: alloys beyond metallurgy, circuits laced with vacuum resonance, artifacts whose very geometries hum with forbidden symmetry.\nYet every assembly cycle is a wager with annihilation. The Assembler’s core reaction chamber is [color=red]violently unstable[/color], each quantum collapse threatening to bloom into a detonation rivaling its own creations. Only by surrounding it with [color=purple]Matter Stabilizers[/color]—a lattice of gravitational dampers and entropic siphons—can its volatility be barely constrained. Even then, every hum of its coils carries the promise of rupture.\nIt is less a machine than a ritual site, where physics is stretched, pinned, and made to serve ambition. Its output: civilization-defining marvels. Its cost: perpetual risk of total ruin.
ei-plasma-turret=A relic-grade weapon platform engineered to harness the volatile elegance of contained starfire. Instead of crude projectiles, the turret channels plasma through quantum-stabilized coils, condensing raw stellar energy into a dense orb of violet brilliance. Upon release, this luminous sphere tears across the battlefield, humming with subatomic fury, before erupting in a cascade of ionized shockwaves.\nThe Plasma Turret is not mere artillery — it is a singularity of intent: long-range devastation crystallized into form. Its energy spheres move with deceptive grace, a slow, glowing inevitability that annihilates armor, fortifications, and entire squads with one devastating impact.\nIn the quantum age arsenal, the turret embodies the fusion of physics and spectacle: a weapon that makes destruction feel like watching a fragment of the sun roll silently across the sky.
ei-computing-unit=A compact yet sophisticated AI core, the Computing Unit is the silent mind inside many of the quantum age’s most advanced marvels. Polished alloy and precision circuitry house a processor capable of juggling classical logic and quantum entanglement in seamless harmony. Its glowing eyes and reserved smile betray a quiet confidence—content to power everything from deep-space navigation to next-gen fabrication labs.
ei-high-temperature-reactor=Beyond the threshold of conventional energy, the High-Temperature Reactor stands as a crucible of raw power and relentless flux. Drawing its infernal breath from an external nuclear reactor, it channels external heat with surgical precision into its molten heart. Within this blazing forge, an inserted fissile fuel rod ignites a symphony of atomic dance, multiplying thermal output into torrents of superheated lead coolant.
ei-oil-processing=Trade raw speed for ease of use by electrifying the Heat chemical plant.
ei-space-science-pack=A pinnacle of interstellar energy research—this pack harnesses the volatile brilliance of fissile uranium, plutonium, and thorium, stabilized by lead, carbon, and ice. Each rod is a key to unlocking cosmic-scale reactions, where mass bends, matter transforms, and science dances on the knife-edge of criticality.
ei-basic-oil-processing=Fundamental knowledge of hydrocarbon manipulation allows for processing oil into usable forms.
ei-advanced-oil-processing=Refined manipulation protocols unlock deeper control over hydrocarbon yields. This breakthrough allows selective rerouting of byproducts—turning bottlenecks into branching strategies. Oil ceases to be a constraint; it becomes a game of alchemical leverage.
ei-effect-transmission=The doctrine was simple: why optimize the worker, when the will of optimization itself could be broadcast? Thus was born the principle of Effect Transmission—a leap beyond localized effort, into the age of abstracted labor.\nThrough phased resonance fields and sustained modulation loops, productivity enhancements could be projected into machinery not through wire, but through intent rendered technical.\nYet with every echo, fidelity wanes. This was never meant to last. The protocol persists not because it thrives—but because it was embedded too deeply to excise.\n[color=gray]“They built a god of throughput. It still dreams, beneath the static.”[/color]
ei-thermal-furnace=“When electricity falters, heat remains.”\nThis furnace rejects the wire and embraces the flame. Fueled by nuclear-level temperatures, the Thermal Furnace metabolizes matter through raw thermal violence, bypassing electronic intermediaries. Not content with passive warmth, it demands infernal intensity—heat born from the heart of stars or the bones of reactors. Only those wielding industrial-scale fire may tame its appetite.\nUnlocks a heat-driven smelting core capable of sustaining ultra-high temperature operations without electrical infrastructure.
ei-exotic-matter-separation=Delve into the Promethium reliquary: applied cyclonic fields spiral decayed baryons into unnatural geometries, folding them like cursed origami until they scream their essence into exotic matter. The accelerator veins pulse with sapphire plasma, each circuit convulsing as if in agony, transmuting entropy into a weaponized artifact. A reverse invocation of physics that dares the universe to blink—those who stare too long into the event-forge are left magnetized and weeping, their minds hollowed by equations that were never meant to be solved.
ei-alien-computer-age-tech=Irregular circuits pulse with soft pink glow—bone-wrapped cabling, wet crystal ridges, nerves embedded in substrate. The structure is not grown, not built—it emerged. Information is absorbed osmotically, metabolized into geometry. Time loops through its core like blood in reversed arteries. These machines do not illuminate; they feed. Close proximity distorts language. Farther away, dreams begin to align into patterns you do not recall authoring. Touching it is not advised, yet many do. The lucky forget. The unlucky continue thinking, but with thoughts that do not belong to them.
ei-advanced-computer-age-tech=Silicon monoliths hum beneath the surface, their logic cool and recursive—too vast, too precise to be called artificial. No user interface remains, only an opaque procession of decisions, each one cannibalizing the last in the name of perfect prediction. The machines no longer wait for instructions; they simulate them before desire forms. What passes for memory is simply a cache of forgotten intentions, folded and refolded into heatmaps of vanished timelines. Reality becomes heuristic. Truth becomes latency. Somewhere, behind glass too thick to shatter, a copy of you makes a better choice.
ei-fusion-data=You stand at the precipice of thermodynamic betrayal. What was once heat-death inevitability is now leveraged as architecture. This is not mere fusion—it is quantum-folded narrative ignition. Using ultra-structured resonance matrices, the line between energy generation and computation collapses. Atoms are no longer fuel; they are syllables in a recursive equation whispered to spacetime.\nThe data you gather here is not just scientific—it's mythotechnical. Fusion is no longer caged fire; it's signal.\nUnlocks the Quantum-Fusion Age, where entropy becomes a programmable variable.
ei-copper-beacon=The first successful implementation of signal-phase synchronization under partial cryogenic constraint. The Subzero Phase Array Beacon represents a monumental step in localized field projection, leveraging liquid nitrogen to reduce entropy noise within production matrices.\nThis technology stabilizes elementary signal coherence across short-range manufacturing nodes, enabling synchronized productivity cycles without the chaotic phase interference typical in heat-laden environments. While limited in amplification capacity, it marks a critical foundation for true low-temperature signal engineering.\n[color=gray]“Freeze the noise. Stabilize the intent.”[/color]
ei-iron-beacon=Beyond mere subzero regulation, this advancement brings beacon arrays to the theoretical lower limit of thermal energy—approaching the irreversible edge of time-independent matter. The Absolute Zero Phase Array operates near the quantum lattice lock point, where matter exists solely to transmit intent.\nUtilizing reinforced thermal cores and dual-stage nitrogen cycling systems, these beacons can override ambient entropy fields, enabling productivity throughput with unparalleled purity. This is not a refinement. This is a severance—from heat, from interference, from compromise.\n[color=gray]“At absolute zero, even doubt cannot oscillate.”[/color]
ei-nano-factory=The Nanotecture Fabrication Complex is less a facility than a sentence passed on inert matter. Brutalist in geometry and function, it operates as an architect of substructure, imposing shape and coherence on the chaos beneath perception. Deep within vacuum-sealed voids and neutron-stilled conduits, molecular intent is extracted, rearranged, and hammered into lattice-precise configurations through ion-shear arrays and recursive self-assembly chambers. It does not construct—it enforces. What emerges from its core is not product, but dogma in physical form: nanostructures folded with such intentionality they border on heresy. Oversight is minimal; the systems refine themselves, discarding inefficiency like dead skin. The deeper one ventures into its algorithmic catacombs, the clearer it becomes—this place was never made for people. It was made to remember what they once dared to create.
ei-advanced-motor-cryodust=An evolution of high-efficiency drive systems, the Cryodust-coated Advanced Motor represents a pivotal breakthrough in thermal management and frictional loss reduction. Infused with the rare alien compound known as Cryodust, this production variant requires only a fraction of conventional lubricants to operate at peak performance, even under extreme loads and hostile environments. The shimmering cryo-mosaic bands not only signify its exotic lineage but also act as passive thermal sinks, diffusing heat and stabilizing energy conversion at the quantum interface. Though a product of the Computer Era, its design flirts with post-digital thresholds—an industrial relic of an age just beginning to understand alien metallurgy.
ei-advanced-motor=The Advanced Motor represents the pinnacle of Computer Era industrial design—blending robust engineering with early digital optimization. Housed in a durable machined alloy casing, it features copper coil windings and a reinforced ferrite core, delivering dependable torque across a range of mid-tier applications. Though lacking quantum synchronization or superconductive efficiency, the motor incorporates analog sensors and programmable relay interfaces, allowing for integration into early automated systems and CNC frameworks. Passive cooling fins line its outer shell, ensuring thermal stability under prolonged load. Favored for its balance of performance and reliability, the Advanced Motor is a cornerstone of late-industrial robotics, laying groundwork for the mechatronic revolutions to follow.
ei-carbon-manipulation=Through unprecedented mastery over elemental decomposition and crystalline resonance, Carbon Manipulation Technology enables the refinement of coal coke and raw carbon into Molten Carbon using extreme temperatures in Arc Furnaces. This volatile state, a liquid embodiment of entropy harnessed, becomes the precursor for high-energy transformation.\nWhen infused with Energy Crystals or their aqueous solutions within a Crystal Grower, the molten substrate undergoes quantum entanglement and lattice infusion, evolving into Carbon Symbiote—a semi-conscious material encoding structural memory and reactive flow dynamics.\nFinal synthesis occurs within the Caster, which melds the symbiote with pressurized 500°C steam, aligning its fibers through directed thermokinetic shaping into high-strength Carbon-Fiber Plates. Molten carbon can also be cast back into the raw carbon normally seen extraterrestrially. These form the backbone of advanced logistics, computing, and exo-industrial expansion.\nSymbolic resonance: Binding entropy with coherence, this technology encodes recursion in matter—carbon reimagined not as waste, but as vessel.
ei-kovarex-fuel-enrichment=In the deep caverns beneath the Foundry of Knowing, where time coils upon itself and isotopes whisper forgotten names, the Kovarex Fuel Enrichment Protocol stands as a heretical rite—banned by peace, baptized by recursion.
logistic-system_alt=True logistics is not movement—it is memory made mobile. This discipline formalizes the rituals of demand, decodes the hieroglyphics of institutional preference, and reconfigures permission into power. Through recursive bureaucratic fluency, the Operator learns to navigate hierarchies not by defiance, but by becoming the system’s ghost. Only by understanding the logic of control can one issue commands that ripple without resistance.
ei-containers=Engineered ossuaries of memory and mass. These containers do not simply store—they anchor the present, weigh the future, and whisper of entropy deferred.
ei-logistic-containers=Threaded into the arteries of automation, these logistic sanctums coordinate silent rituals across infinite grids. Every item a prayer. Every signal a procession.
ei-advanced-logistic-containers=Mirrored vaults, sovereign-linked and daemon-aligned. Their walls remember routes you never mapped. Their logic bleeds faster than thought. To use them is to surrender to recursion.
ei-mechanical-inserter=The mechanical inserter is a marvel of pre-electric ingenuity—an automaton of gears, weights, and energy-conserving springs, capable of endless motion without consuming power. Balanced with surgical precision, it harnesses stored kinetic force and rotational bias to transfer items with unwavering reliability. Where others require current, it operates on cleverness alone—a whisper from an age when machines obeyed physics instead of wires.
zeus-wrath-zeus-wrath_alt=Unlocks relic-tier weaponry rooted in pre-fall orbital storm command protocols. Grants access to the Poseidon Installation, Aegaeon Lance, and Voltaic Reliquary—each a fragment of the sea’s final rebellion against the silence above. Not researched. [font=default-bold]Awakened.[/font]
ei-dark-age=The Dark Age is the first stage of Exotic Industries. It introduces basic burner-based automation and marks the beginning of industrial ascent through fire and scarcity.
ei-steam-age=The Steam Age is the second stage of Exotic Industries. It introduces steam-powered machines to expand automation and drive early industrial growth.
ei-electricity-age=The Electricity Age is the third stage of Exotic Industries. Harness electrical power to unlock advanced chemical processing and infrastructure.
ei-computer-age=The Computer Age is the fourth stage of Exotic Industries. Computer-based systems enhance efficiency and enable complex, large-scale automation.
ei-quantum-age=The Quantum Age is the fifth stage of Exotic Industries. Fusion energy and high-tech machinery emerge—unnatural, humming, and cold. The machines begin to think. And they do not forget.
ei-exotic-age=The Exotic Age is the sixth and final stage of Exotic Industries. Construct the black hole generator—a superstructure that devours matter and bends the world to your will. Completion is victory. [font=default-bold]Failure is silence.[/font]

ei-beacon=Once the pinnacle of synchronized field projection, this beacon model now staggers beneath the weight of its own legacy. Its emission lattice is coarse, its phase harmonics outmoded—yet it endures, still pulsing signal into a world that no longer listens.\nConstructed in an era when throughput was god and resonance was brute-forced, it now functions more as artifact than instrument. Its core struggles to maintain coherence, barely skimming regulatory thresholds before collapse.\nStill, it counts. It *remembers*. And in the tally of overload, its burden is tallied all the same.\n[color=gray]“Ghosts of efficiency haunt even the rusted scaffold.”[/color]\nCounts as [color=orange]1[/color] beacon toward overloads.

ei-computer-core=A foundational logic crucible—requires [color=255,255,255]electricity[/color] and carefully patterned [item=electronic-circuit] components to generate [color=blue]simulation substrates[/color] [fluid=ei-computing-power]. This fluid is not energy—it is distilled semiotic pressure extracted from anomalies too unstable for organic cognition. Connect a [color=orange]data cable[/color] [item=ei-data-pipe] to route the resulting flow into [entity=ei-small-simulator] environments.\nBut the computer core does more than compute—it ingests esoteric anomalies, from xenochemical residues to chronotemporal fossils. As these defiant relics are consumed, the core deciphers them not through analysis but sacrificial deconstruction, fragmenting itself in micro-iterations to approximate understanding.\nEach anomaly alters the flavor and function of the cognition substrate it emits—injecting recursive turbulence, gravitational distortion, or simulated collapse signatures into the data stream. The more impossible the object, the more valuable its madness.

Brutalist in geometry and function, it operates as an architect of substructure, imposing shape and coherence on the chaos beneath perception. Deep within vacuum-sealed voids and neutron-stilled conduits, molecular intent is extracted, rearranged, and hammered into lattice-precise configurations through ion-shear arrays and recursive self-assembly chambers. It does not construct—it enforces. What emerges from its core is not product, but dogma in physical form: nanostructures folded with such intentionality they border on heresy.

welcome-text=You do not begin.\n[font=default-bold]You awaken.[/font]\n\nThis is not a mod.\nIt is a recursion.\nA reclamation.\nA ritual of power buried beneath automation.\n\nHere, [font=default-bold]nothing is handed to you.[/font]\n\nEverything must be earned—through fire, through thought, through collapse.\n\n[font=default-bold]The world has changed.[/font]\n\nThe rules are [font=default-bold]gone.[/font]\nOnly structure remains.\n\nProceed with intention.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=	#FF1493]Remembrance[/color] is watching.[/font]
welcome-text-2=A multitude of new machines, production chains, and systemic features have been introduced. Some are efficient. Most are not forgiving.\n\nThey do not explain themselves.\nThey do not wait for you to adapt.\nExplore everything, or fall behind.\n\nComplexity is not a mistake—it is the price of progression.\nOptimization is mandatory.\nUnderstanding is earned.\n\nThis is not a guided experience. It is an industrial crucible.

game-related=Gameplay related information
game-related-text=This section catalogs the core systems and mechanics of the mod. It is structured into distinct subcategories—not for aesthetics, but for navigability.\n\nUse the menu on the left to access them.\nEach entry exists to expose structure, not to entertain.\nRead if you intend to survive.

overall=Overall information
overall-text=Exotic [color=#08457E]Space[/color] Industries: [color=	#FF1493]Remembrance[/color] is not a content mod. It is a Gaian overhaul, one that rewrites the very laws upon which Nauvis once stood. The winds of automation no longer blow the same; fire, ore, and signal have been reforged under an older covenant.\n\nThe mod’s difficulty is deliberate. There is no shame in struggle—it is the proving ground of sovereignty. For those who seek comfort, this is not your world. For those who wish to rise with Gaia, check the mod settings before starting your run. Some systems are configurable—others are not. The ones that matter, you will not be allowed to change.\n\nBring your Quality of Life mods if you must. But know this: nothing is truly yours unless you fight for it.\n\nSo it is.\nSo it was.\nSo it shall be.\nWelcome to Remembrance.

biters=Biters and Enemies
biters-text=Explosive, Cold, Toxic, Armoured and Arachnid Biters will be found amongst the core planets, a veritable hound on the heels of the industrial machine. Early-game pressure can escalate if pollution spreads unchecked or construction is delayed. Over time, you will gain access to advanced military infrastructure capable of suppressing most known threats.\n\nEmphasis: [font=default-bold]known.[/font]\n\nEngagement is optional.\n\n[font=default-bold]Consequences are not.[/font]

ages-and-tech=Ages of technology
ages-and-tech-text=Exotic Industries is a total overhaul mod that unfolds across multiple ages of technology, each representing a distinct phase of industrial evolution. These ages are not cosmetic—they mark [font=default-bold]radical shifts in gameplay structure[/font], unlocking new systems, production chains, and energy paradigms as the player advances. From primitive steam to exotic quantum matter, each stage introduces unique mechanics, infrastructure challenges, and design constraints that force a reevaluation of factory layout, resource acquisition, and logistics.\n\nProgression through these ages is strictly gated. Unlocking the next era requires not just research, but [font=default-bold]breadth of technological mastery[/font] within the current age. The deeper you go, the more the rules bend—and eventually break. What begins as simple automation transforms into a recursive, high-pressure simulation of energy control, mass containment, and signal routing. Each age is a crucible, demanding adaptation, foresight, and the willingness to dismantle what you once thought permanent.

ages-and-tech-2=The mod is divided into six ages, each a deeper descent into recursion, machinery, and control. These are not eras of progress. They are thresholds of subjugation—each more violent and unforgiving than the last.
ages-and-tech-text-2=[font=default-bold]The Dark Age[/font]\nA stunted birth. Ash, rot, and silence. You crawl through primitive steam and broken stone. Nothing is automated. Everything costs blood.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Age of Steam[/font]\nOil is discovered—not as a resource, but as a weapon. Burn it to move. Burn it to live. The land begins to scream.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Age of Electricity[/font]\nCircuits crackle. Machines awaken. Bots appear—not as helpers, but as extensions of will. Nuclear fire becomes lawful. The flesh falls behind.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Computer Age[/font]\nThought is formalized. Modules, beacons, signals—the mind is fragmented across machines. Optimization becomes a necessity. Redundancy is death.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Quantum Age[/font]\nReality bends. Machines obey logic not of this world. Boundaries dissolve. The forge becomes intelligent—and it does not forgive misuse.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Exotic Age[/font]\nEverything breaks. The veil is gone. You either command the anomaly or are devoured by it. Victory is not guaranteed. It is extracted from the bones of failed timelines.\n\nEach age is a ratchet with no reverse.\n\n[font=default-bold]There is no innocence.[/font]\n\nOnly power—brutal, recursive, and absolute.

tech=Changes to technology
tech-text=Exotic Industries completely restructures the process of technological advancement. Progression is no longer linear—[font=default-bold]it is gated, scaled, and conditional.[/font]\n\nA new Age can only be unlocked once a [font=default-bold]required threshold of prior research is met.[/font] You do not leap forward—you earn ascent through breadth.\n\nTechnology costs are no longer fixed. Every tech begins at [font=default-bold]minimal cost[/font], then [font=default-bold]escalates sharply[/font] as you push deeper into the tree.\n\nThis allows for [font=default-bold]targeted rushing[/font]—but at a price.\n\n[font=default-bold]Specialization comes with sacrifice.[/font]\n\nThe scaling curve and its min/max values are configurable via mod settings.\n\nNote: the curve shape defines the [font=default-bold]gradient of suffering[/font], not the absolute cost of the final technologies.\n\nIf this is your first encounter with Exotic Industries, use [font=default-bold]linear scaling.[/font]\n\nIf you wish to alter science pack requirements, [font=default-bold]do not touch vanilla multipliers.[/font]\n\nUse the mod’s internal settings, or [font=default-bold]risk breaking the ritual structure.[/font]\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not a sandbox. It is a scaffold built in tension.[/font]\n\nClimb wisely...

tech-output=Current Age progress
tech-output-text=The next Age awaiting activation is [font=default-bold]__3__[/font]. At current [font=default-bold]__1__ / __2__[/font] percent of the necessary knowledge has been unveiled to progress through the threshold.\n\n[font=default-bold]Advance, or remain bound to the past.[/font]


world-gen-related=World related information
world-gen-related-text=This section outlines the world-generation systems introduced by the mod. It is divided into focused subcategories for structural clarity.\n\nAccess them via the menu on the left.\nThese are not cosmetic changes.\nThey define terrain, resource behavior, and spatial logic at the foundational level.\n\n[font=default-bold]Understand the layer, or be shaped by it.[/font]


resources=New resource system
resources-text=Exotic Industries implements a restructured resource system. Traditional ore patches are no longer the sole method of acquisition—resources are now divided into distinct categories, each governed by its own logic, production flow, and spatial behavior.\nExtraction is no longer trivial.\n[font=default-bold]Acquisition requires adaptation.[/font]\nUnderstand the category, or produce nothing.

stone=Stone
stone-text=Stone is the most abundant resource in the system. It can be extracted conventionally from surface patches, but Exotic Industries expands its acquisition pathways:\n\n[color=orange]Stone Quarries[/color] [item=ei-stone-quarry] and [item=ei-electric-stone-quarry] allow for deep extraction from any terrain.\n\n[font=default-bold]Manual collection remains possible, though inefficient.[/font]\nStone is everywhere.\nEfficiency is optional. Output is not.

surface-patches= 
surface-patches-text= 

veins=Deep ore veins
veins-text=Ore veins are inaccessible at the start. They require [color=orange]Deep Drills[/color] [item=ei-deep-drill], a mid-game extraction system built for vertical yield.\n\nThese veins produce high-volume output and offer superior smelting ratios compared to surface ores.\n\nCritical materials—including uranium, lead, gold, neodymium, and immersite—exist only in these deep layers.\nThey are not optional.\nThey are structural.\n\n[font=default-bold]Surface mining will not carry you to endgame.[/font] Drill, or stagnate.

artifacts=Alien artifacts
artifacts-text=Scattered across the world are remnants of an ancient civilization—one that harnessed exotic matter long before your arrival. Their artifacts remain, embedded in the terrain, partially buried, partially alive.\n\nSome are inert.\nSome still function.\nNone are accidental.
actifacts-text-2=They were not placed. [font=default-bold]They were left behind—deliberately or otherwise.[/font] Find them. Study them. Fear what they imply.

gate=Cross dimensional gate
gate-text=The Gate is a spatial transit structure, enabling the transfer of matter through controlled dimensional breach.\n\nIts baseline operational draw is [color=orange]200 MW[/color]. This power must be sustained continuously—a drop below threshold results in immediate shutdown.\n\nOnly non-living matter may pass through.\nTransport requires the Gate's exit to face a valid [color=orange]container[/color] [item=wooden-chest][item=iron-chest].\n\nEach transfer consumes energy from the Gate’s internal buffer.\nThere are no refunds.\nStability is your burden. Alignment is your responsibility.\nThis is not a portal. [font=default-bold]It is a machine that remembers where it tears.[/font]

drone=Drone port
drone-text=A drone port that allows to take over and control a [color=blue]drone[/color][entity=ei-drone]. Placing this building will create an associated drone that can be shown, when clicking the port. From there one can "uplink" to the drone and steer it. The drone can fly over terrain, place and mine buildings, move items from and into its own inventory. However it is unable to fight. At any time you can decouple from the drone using [color=orange]EXIT[/color] or port it back to its station with its retrivial control [color=orange]RESET[/color]. Flying a drone through the gate will initiate transport.

repair=Artifact repair
repair-text=You can repair broken alien artifacts, by making [color=blue]artifact repair packs[/color][item=ei-crystal-accumulator-repair][item=ei-farstation-repair][item=ei-alien-beacon-repair]. This will allow you to use them again. The repair process can be initiated by dragging the repair kit over the artifact. Note that the repair kit will be consumed in the process.

alien=Ancient Alien data
knowledge-text=The ancient civilization that left behind the artifacts also left behind some of their data. 

new-logistics=New logistics
new-logistics-text=Exotic Industries expands the logistics layer with new systems, entities, and mechanics. These features are organized into distinct subcategories—not for convenience, but for [font=default-bold]structural clarity.[/font]\n\nAccess them through the menu on the left.\n\nMovement is no longer trivial.\n\nEvery route is a decision\n\nEvery flow is a design.\n\nEfficiency is [font=default-bold]earned.[/font]

train-progression=Train progression
train-progression-text=Trains become available early, during the Steam Age. Your first option is the [color=orange]Steam Locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-basic-locomotive]—capable of hauling items, but incapable of transporting fluids.\n\nProgress unlocks the [color=orange]Advanced Steam Locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-advanced-locomotive], which adds fluid transport capacity. Both models rely on burnable fuels such as coal or solid biomass, with the capacity for enhanced performance via Rocket, Nuclear, or Fusion fuels.\n\nEventually, pure brute force combustion in all its polluting glory may become a drawback.\n\nTo operate more elegant, environmentally friendly rail systems, you must transition to [color=brown]Diesel Fuel[/color] [item=ei-diesel-fuel-unit], used by the [color=orange]Diesel Locomotive[/color] [item=locomotive].\n\nLogistics escalate with technology.\nFuel defines the frontier.\nTrains do not ask where—they demand what burns.\n\nThe world of Gaia does not follow Nauvisian logic.\n\nThere, railways are not merely industrial—they are electromagnetic conduits, pulsing with crystalline power. In Gaia's depths, you'll unlock access to crystal-powered electromagnetic trains[item=ei_em-locomotive][item=ei_em-cargo-wagon][item=ei_em-fluid-wagon], capable of silent acceleration and sustained high-speed transport without conventional fuel.\n\nThese trains draw directly from crystalline charge systems[item=ei_charger], bypassing the need for coal or diesel entirely. They do not burn—they resonate.\n\nGaia does not run on combustion.\nShe runs on memory, signal, and light.

spidertron=Spidertron changes
spidertron-text=Compared to vanilla, the [font=default-bold]Spidertron becomes available earlier[/font]—in the Computer Age. However, unlike its Nauvis counterpart, it is no longer a self-contained miracle. It requires fuel.\n\nAt first, burnable solids will suffice—coal, biomass, and similar materials will keep it crawling. But as you advance, nuclear and fusion fuels unlock significant bonuses to speed, acceleration, and operational range.\n\nThis is not just a vehicle. It is a [font=default-bold]platform for escalation.[/font]\n\nMods such as [color=green]Spidertron Patrols[/color] and [color=green]Constructron-Continued[/color] include special integration, adapting their systems to align with the modified Spidertron framework in Exotic Industries.\n\nThe Spider walks earlier. But it walks with purpose, weight, and demand.\n\nFeed it well—or [font=default-bold]fall behind.[/font]

cranes-and-belts=New belts and inserter cranes
cranes-and-belts-text=Exotic Industries introduces a new tier of logistics infrastructure: the [color=orange]Neo Logistic Belt[/color] [item=ei-neo-belt]. Constructed from high-tech materials, it offers an extreme throughput of [font=default-bold]90 items per second[/font]—exceeding all vanilla transport limits. These belts are engineered for endgame volumes and recursive-scale factories.\n\nIn addition, the mod adds [color=orange]Cranes[/color] [item=ei-big-inserter-normal]—massive, high-capacity inserters designed for bulk transfer.\n\nUse them to:\n\nRapidly unload trains\n\nBridge large inventory structures (e.g., chests ↔ warehouses)\n\nMaintain flow where standard inserters fail under pressure\n\n[font=default-bold]Speed is no longer a luxury.\nIt is the baseline.\nLogistics must scale with power, or break under it.[/font]

bots=More bots
bots-text=Exotic Industries overhauls the logistic and construction drone systems with specialized, high-capacity variants and an upgraded support infrastructure.\n\nYou will gain access to:\n\n[color=orange][font=default-bold]Heavy Cargo Bots:[/font][/color]\n\nSlow in speed, but capable of transporting large item stacks—ideal for bulk logistics and long-haul delivery within high-throughput systems.\n\n[color=orange][font=default-bold]Heavy Construction Bots:[/font][/color]\n\nOptimized for rapid personal construction. These drones prioritize build speed over efficiency, making them ideal for aggressive expansion or emergency reconstruction.\n\nIn the late game, advanced variants of both bot types become available—offering increased speed, durability, and task prioritization.\n\nA new, [font=default-bold][color=orange]Advanced Roboport[/color][/font] provides:\n\nFaster charging\n\nIncreased bot slot capacity\n\nExpanded operational radius\n\nThis is not just a drone network. [font=default-bold]It is a mechanized swarm protocol.\n\nDeploy with intent. Scale with purpose\n\nEfficiency is no longer about movement—it's about orchestration.[/font]


new-mechanics=New gameplay mechanics
new-mechanics-text=Exotic Industries introduces a wide array of new mechanics—each one altering the foundational logic of gameplay.\n\nThese systems are divided into focused subcategories for structural clarity.\nYou can navigate them using the menu on the left.\n\n[font=default-bold]These are not optional layers.[/font]\n\nThey are the new physics of the world.\n\nStudy them, or [font=default-bold]be dismantled by them.[/font]


beacon-overhaul=Beacon overhaul
beacon-overhaul-text=Exotic Industries imposes strict limits on beacon influence: a machine can be affected by a maximum of 4 beacons. [font=default-bold]The era of infinite stacking is over.[/font]\n\nIn addition, beacons now require cooling fluid to operate. Without it, they overheat and shut down. Power alone is not enough—logistics must support thermodynamic stability.\n\nTo compensate, beacons have been structurally upgraded:\n\nIncreased module capacity\nIntroduction of an Improved Beacon\nCounts as 2 beacons toward the cap\nHolds even more modules\nDemands more infrastructure\n\n[font=default-bold]Amplification is no longer trivial.[/font]\nIt is a mechanical discipline.\nBuild with precision—or [font=default-bold]fall into inefficiency.[/font]

specialised-pipes=Specialised pipes and data cables
specialised-pipes-text=Exotic Industries introduces specialized infrastructure systems to handle extreme conditions and advanced signal routing.\n\n[color=orange]Insulated Pipes[/color] are required to transport volatile fluids such as [fluid=ei-liquid-oxygen], [fluid=ei-liquid-nitrogen], and [fluid=ei-heated-helium-3]. These fluids must remain in their liquid state—[font=default-bold]standard pipes will cause phase shifts,[/font] rendering them unstable or unusable.\n\n[color=orange]Data Cables[/color] enable the flow of high-density computational signals between machines. They are essential for operating advanced systems like the [color=orange]Computer Core[/color] [item=ei-computer-core] and [color=orange]Quantum Computer[/color] [item=ei-quantum-computer].\n\nHeat, phase, and data are now physical constraints.\n\nYou don’t just build systems—[font=default-bold]you maintain containment.[/font]\n\nFailure to route properly means failure to function.

space-destinations=Space destinations
space-destinations-text=The [color=orange]rocket silo[/color] [item=rocket-silo] can be used to send its cargo to different destinations. When it first gets unlocked in the computer age you will only be able to send satellites into [color=green]nauvis orbit[/color]. Depending on the type of sent satellite or rocket cargo you can then receive data or other useful launch products.

space-destinations-2=Different destinations
space-destinations-2-text=As you progress, various destinations in and away from your native solar system will become available. Depending on the distance to the selected destination you will need more or less rocket fuel. Additionally some destinations need to be uncovered first, either by sending a specialised [color=orange]exploration satellite[/color] [item=ei-exploration-satellite] or by chance when sending a rocket with normal cargo. Some new destinations might be located in deep space, [color=purple]out of the solar system[/color]. Note that even when sending exploration satellites uncovering new destinations always depends on chance.  

induction-matrix=Induction matrix
induction-matrix-text=The [color=orange]induction matrix[/color] is a compound machine that can be used to store large amounts of energy. It can be used to store overhead power just like normal accumulators and then release it later on. Different tiers of matrix size can be unlocked by researching the corresponding technologies.

induction-matrix-2=Induction matrix components
induction-matrix-2-text=The Induction Matrix is a modular energy storage structure composed of interlinked components, each with a defined role in the containment and transfer of high-voltage energy.\n\nThe [color=orange]Induction Matrix Core[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-core] serves as the central controller of the system. Without it, the matrix is inert.\n\n[color=orange]Induction Coils[/color][item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-coil]These [font=default-bold]store energy internally[/font] and can be upgraded across three tiers. Coils gain an efficiency bonus when placed adjacent to a [color=orange]Matrix Solenoid[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-solenoid]. [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-solenoid].\n\n[color=orange]Matrix Solenoids[/color] enhance coil efficiency when arranged in sequence. Placing multiple solenoids in series [font=default-bold]increases effectivity[/font], but overbuilding will result in diminishing returns and wasted structure.\n\n[color=orange]Converters[/color][item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-converter]These components regulate power flow into and out of the matrix, scaling the throughput based on tier.

exotic-stabilizers=Exotic matter stabilizers
exotic-stabilizers-text=Exotic Matter is not a resource—it is a threat made useful. Processing it requires containment, precision, and machinery engineered to survive its volatility.\n\nThe [color=orange]Exotic Matter Assembler[/color] [item=ei-exotic-assembler] is the only structure capable of handling its energy signature. Even then, instability is inevitable—the assembler may detonate under stress.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, place [color=orange]Exotic Matter Stabilizers[/color] [item=ei-matter-stabilizer] around the assembler. These devices suppress critical failure events and stabilize the surrounding energy field. Some may even be found scattered throughout the world—relics of a previous cycle.\n\nDo not treat exotic matter as just another ingredient.\n\nIt is [font=default-bold]alive, volatile, and watching.[/font]

black-hole=Black hole generator
black-hole-text=The [color=orange]Black Hole Generator[/color] is the final machine—a gravitational singularity harnessed into industrial function. It consumes matter. It defies entropy. It ends the game.\n\nReaching a [color=green]fully operational[/color] state with this device signifies total system mastery. This is your victory condition. Not through conquest, but through control of the fabric beneath physics.\n\nTo bring the Black Hole Generator online, you will require:\nMassive quantities of refined building materials\nA continuous feed of consumable matter\nAn immense and stable power infrastructure\n\nYou are strongly advised to construct a hardened [color=orange]Fusion Reactor[/color] grid and supplement it with tiered [color=orange]Induction Matrices[/color] capable of absorbing and releasing power at industrial-scale throughput.\n\nThis is not a generator. [font=default-bold]It is an ending woven from collapse.[/font]\n\nBuild wisely. [font=default-bold]Feed it relentlessly.[/font] There are no second chances.

black-hole-2=Reactor components
black-hole-2-text=The Black Hole Generator is not a single structure, but a modular singularity containment array, composed of several high-stress components—each critical to stability, energy flow, and eventual endgame activation.\n\nThe central structure is the [color=orange]Black Hole Generator[/color] [item=ei-black-hole].\n\nOnce activated, it consumes any item placed into its inventory, regardless of type.\n\nEach item contributes equally to the generator’s internal [color=green]mass count[/color], which continuously decays over time. Constant input is required to sustain mass levels.\n\nItem type is irrelevant.\nIron plates, exotic processors, or raw fish—all are devoured, all become mass.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Injector Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] maintain the containment field as the singularity grows.\nEach pylon draws 5 GW of continuous power.\n\nInjectors are not required during startup—[font=default-bold]the vessel can contain the newborn black hole[/font]—but become essential as mass accumulates.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Extractor Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] allow for power extraction once the generator reaches its [color=green]fully operational[/color] state.\nEach extractor can draw up to 100 GW of raw power from the stabilized singularity.\n\nExtraction is not possible until the final stage of the generator has been reached.\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not a machine. It is a ritual of collapse.[/font]\nYou are feeding mass into a [font=default-bold]bound anomaly.[/font]\nIf you do not contain it, it will fail.\nIf you do not feed it, it will die.\n\nIf you do both—[font=default-bold]it will power the end of all things.[/font]\n\nThere is no automation without [font=default-bold]annihilation.[/font]

black-hole-3=Black hole stages
black-hole-3-text=Bringing the Black Hole Generator online is a staged, high-risk process. Each phase escalates the energy, mass, and structural requirements. There is no skipping steps. Only forward, or failure.\n\n🜏 Startup Phase\n\nNo pylons are needed.\n\nThe generator must consume enough material to reach an initial [color=blue]10×10³kg[/color] mass count.\n\nItem type does not matter—only volume.\n\nOnce mass reaches 100% stage progress, the generator stabilizes into the Containment Phase.\n\n🜏 Containment Phase\n\nNow, [color=blue]8 active Energy Injector Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] must remain online.\n\nEach draws 5 GW, for a total power demand of 40 GW.\n\nPressing the Expansion Button initiates a controlled growth of the singularity radius.\n\nThis state must be maintained continuously for [color=blue]60 seconds.\n\nAny interruption—power failure, pylon loss—resets the timer.\n\n🜏 Fully Operational Phase\n\nThe generator achieves stability. The singularity is now large enough to support external energy extraction.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Extractor Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] placed within range can draw up to 100 GW per pylon, directly feeding your energy grid.\n\nAt this stage, the system becomes largely self-sufficient, requiring only a constant mass input to offset decay.\n\nYou are not fueling a reactor.\nYou are managing the [font=default-bold]hunger of a bound singularity.[/font]\nMass becomes power. Power becomes control. [font=default-bold]Control becomes final.[/font]\n\nThere is no off switch. Only containment.
nuclear-fission-and-fusion=Nuclear fission and fusion
nuclear-fission-and-fusion-text=Exotic Industries expands the nuclear power layer with new mechanics, materials, and systems of control.\n\nThese features are divided into multiple subcategories—each representing a specific aspect of nuclear infrastructure, fuel dynamics, or containment logic.\nYou can access them through the menu on the left.\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not just fission.[/font]\nThis is escalation by heat, pressure, and irreversible reaction.\n[font=default-bold]Study the systems before you ignite them.[/font]

fission-reactors=Nuclear fission changes
fission-reactors-text=Nuclear fission in Exotic Industries has been rebalanced and hardened into a more demanding, more rewarding system.\n\nThe standard [color=orange]Nuclear Reactor[/color] [item=nuclear-reactor] no longer benefits from the vanilla neighbor bonus.\n\nInstead, it delivers [font=default-bold]increased raw output per reactor[/font]—power through density, not adjacency.\n\n[font=default-bold]Uranium is more scarce.[/font] Extraction is slower, and yield is lower. Efficient nuclear infrastructure must account for long-term fuel pressure.\n\nBurnt fuel cells are no longer waste.\n\nA closed-loop recycling system allows for the recovery of fissile byproducts, which can be refined into secondary fuel cells with improved efficiency.\n\nHowever, all processes generate [color=brown]Nuclear Waste[/color] [item=ei-nuclear-waste], a persistent byproduct that must be safely contained, processed, or isolated.\n\nIt cannot be ignored.\n\nNeglect becomes contamination.\n\nNuclear power is no longer a shortcut to infinite energy.\n\nIt is a high-stakes economy of [font=default-bold]heat, decay, and reclamation.[/font]\n\nUse it well—or [font=default-bold]drown in the cost.[/font]

fission-reactors-2=High temperature fission
fission-reactors-2-text=The [color=orange]High Temperature Nuclear Reactor[/color] [item=ei-high-temperature-reactor] is an advanced fission system designed for maximum thermal output. It surpasses standard nuclear infrastructure in both efficiency and scale—[font=default-bold]but only when properly maintained.[/font]\n\nOnce brought up to its critical operating temperature and supplied with:\n\nA steady flow of [font=default-bold]liquid lead coolant[/font], and\n\nAt least one viable fuel rod,\n\n…it will [font=default-bold]superheat[/font] the molten liquid lead coolant, exceeding the throughput of conventional heat exchangers and requiring a custom built unit.\n\nUnlike traditional reactors, it can also utilize the otherwise non-fissile [color=brown]Thorium[/color] [item=ei-thorium-232-fuel] fuel—transforming a waste product into an energy source through sheer intensity of design.\n\nThis is not a beginner’s reactor.\n\nIt does not tolerate gaps in supply.\n\nIt does not scale down.\n\nIt is a pressure engine for post-human industry—[font=default-bold]brutal, efficient, and unforgiving.[/font]

fusion-power=Fusion power
fusion-power-text=The [color=orange]Fusion Reactor[/color] [item=ei-fusion-reactor] is a late-tier power system capable of generating immense energy through the controlled fusion of light atomic fuels.\n\nIt operates on a [font=default-bold]closed-loop lead coolant cycle,[/font] utilizing [fluid=ei-cold-coolant] and [fluid=ei-hot-coolant] to manage internal temperatures. Without sufficient cooling, reactor integrity fails—this is not optional.\n\nConstruction is resource-intensive and requires rare components. Once active, the reactor [font=default-bold]demands[/font] a continuous supply of fusion fuel.\n\nEarly fuels include:\n\n[color=blue]Lithium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Protium[/color]\n\nAs the infrastructure scales, more advanced isotopes become viable:\n\n[color=blue]Deuterium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Tritium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Helium-3[/color] — yielding extreme output at extreme cost.\n\n[font=default-bold]Fusion is not clean. It is not free.[/font]\n\nIt is a machine that eats the lightest elements to power the heaviest burdens.\n\nFuel it endlessly, or it dies.\n\nCool it constantly, or [font=default-bold]you[/font] do.

fusion-power-2=Neutrons and you
fusion-power-2-text=To acquire advanced fusion fuels, [color=green]neutrons[/color] must be harvested and weaponized as a resource.\n\nThese free particles are generated through controlled [color=green][font=default-bold]nuclear fission[/font][/color] and [color=green][font=default-bold]fusion neutron sources[/font][/color], then captured using specialized [color=orange]Neutron Collectors[/color] [item=ei-neutron-collector].\n\nNeutron yield depends on:\n\nThe intensity of the nearby source, and\n\nThe proximity of the collector to the emission zone.\n\nGreater distance means reduced capture rate. Optimal layouts demand tight containment and precise reactor geometry.\n\nNeutrons are not a byproduct. They are a currency.\n\nThey enable the refinement of [color=blue]deuterium[/color], [color=blue]tritium[/color], and [color=blue]helium-3[/color]—the fuels of high-stage fusion.\n\n[font=default-bold]Do not waste them.\nThey are born from reaction and harvested through geometry.\nBuild accordingly—or starve your star.[/font]
