# PAGES
welcome=Welcome to Exotic Industries!
welcome-text=This is the wiki page. Here you can find information about the mod, its features and mechanics. Also new discoveries might trigger the appearance of new entries in this wiki so be sure to check it from time to time. If you have questions or problems, feel free to ask them on the mod's discord server. You can find the link to the server in the mod's description on the mod portal.
welcome-text-2=A lot of new machines, production chains and unique features await you in this mod some easy and some are more challenging. Be sure to explore them! 

game-related=Gameplay related information
game-related-text=This section contains information about the mod's gameplay features and mechanics. It is divided into several subcategories. You can find them in the menu on the left.

overall=Overall information
overall-text=Exotic Industries is an overhaul mod, that influences/completely reworks nearly any aspect of vanilla factorio. Naturally Exotic Industries has no built-in integration for other big mods like Krastorio 2 or SE. Recommended mods, which are listed in the official modpack mod, come with native integration for Exotic Industries. For the best experience, it is recommended to use these mods alongside Quality of Life mods of your own choice. Be sure to check the mod settings before starting a new run as some important aspects of the mod can be tuned using them.

biters=Biters and Enemies
biters-text=Enemies play a minor role in Exotic Industries. In the early game, they can become a threat if you building very slow and don't watch pollution. However as the mod does not add any new enemies or stronger ones, dealing with biters becomes easier as the game progresses. In the late-game you will have access to various strong military options. Therefore you might consider increasing the starting area beforehand. Some biter bases mods are recommended in the official modpack.

ages-and-tech=Ages of technology
ages-and-tech-text=Exotic Industries is a mod that spans over several ages of technology. Each age has its own unique features and mechanics. 

ages-and-tech-2=Dark, Steam, Electricity, Computer, Quantum and Exotic Ages
ages-and-tech-text-2=These are the six ages the mod is divided into. The Dark Age is very short, guiding towards you first steam based factory. Oil is available early on and can be used as a fuel source or to defend against biters. With building the first electronic devices the age of electricity begins. Various sources of power become available. Bots and nuclear fission are introduced in this age. The Computer Age introduces beacons and modules. High tech machinery will become available in the Quantum Age. And finally the Exotic Age will allow you to win the game.

tech=Changes to technology
tech-text=Exotic Industries changes the way technology is researched. A new age can only be researched if a certain percentage of techs from the previous age are already researched beforehand. In addition to that, the cost of techs is changed in Exotic Industries. All techs start with a minimal research price and become more expensive as you progress through the tech tree. This allows to rush certain techs if you like to. Scaling of this tech cost and the min/max value can be tuned under mod settings. Note that the curve form does not affect the price of the last tech but rather the scaling towards it. If you play EI for the first time keep the tech scaling linear. If you wish to use a science multiplier DO NOT use the vanilla version but instead use the mod settings. 

tech-output=Current Age progress
tech-output-text=The next age you need to progress to is the [font=default-bold]__3__[/font]. You currently have [font=default-bold]__1__ / __2__[/font] percent of needed techs researched, in order to unlock the next age.


world-gen-related=World related information
world-gen-related-text=This section contains information about the mod's world generation features and mechanics. It is divided into several subcategories. You can find them in the menu on the left.


resources=New resource system
resources-text=Exotic Industries introduces a new resource system. Rather than only having ore patches, resources are separated into various categories.

stone=Stone
stone-text=Stone is the most common resource in the game. There are no patches where it spawns, but instead stone can be mined from everywhere using a [color=orange]stone quarry[/color] [item=ei-stone-quarry][item=ei-electric-stone-quarry]. In addition to these quarries the player is capable of collecting stone by hand.

surface-patches= 
surface-patches-text= 

veins=Deep ore veins
veins-text=Ore veins are only accessible later in the game by using [color=orange]deep drills[/color] [item=ei-deep-drill]. They yield high outputs and better smelting ratios. Also some materials as uranium, lead, gold and neodym can only be mined from these veins.

artifacts=Alien artifacts
artifacts-text=Some artifacts have been left behind by an ancient civilization that was able to harness the power of exotic matter. You can find their artifacts scattered across the world. Some of them might even still work.

actifacts-text-2=But be careful, they might be untouched for some reason...

gate=Cross dimensional gate
gate-text=The gate allows the transport through space. The gate itself has a power draw of up to [color=orange]50 MW[/color], that needs to be supplied in order to keep it running. Droping below this value will shut down the gate. Only non-living objects can be transported through the gate. However for a successfull item transport the gate needs its exit pointing towards any [color=orange]container[/color][item=wooden-chest][item=iron-chest]. Transporting items consumes energy form the internal gate buffer.

drone=Drone port
drone-text=A drone port that allows to take over and control a [color=blue]drone[/color][entity=ei-drone]. Placing this building will create an associated drone that can be shown, when clicking the port. From there one can "uplink" to the drone and steer it. The drone can fly over terrain, place and mine buildings, move items from and into its own inventory. However it is unable to fight. At any time you can decouple from the drone using [color=orange]EXIT[/color] or port it back to its station with its retrivial control [color=orange]RESET[/color]. Flying a drone through the gate will initiate transport.

repair=Artifact repair
repair-text=You can repair broken alien artifacts, by making [color=blue]artifact repair packs[/color][item=ei-crystal-accumulator-repair][item=ei-farstation-repair][item=ei-alien-beacon-repair]. This will allow you to use them again. The repair process can be initiated by dragging the repair kit over the artifact. Note that the repair kit will be consumed in the process.

alien=Ancient Alien data
knowledge-text=The ancient civilization that left behind the artifacts also left behind some of their data. 

new-logistics=New logistics
new-logistics-text=Exotic Industries also introduces some new logistics features. These features are divided into several subcategories. You can find them in the menu on the left.

train-progression=Train progression
train-progression-text=Trains are available from early on in the steam age. At first you can only build a basic [color=orange]steam locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-basic-locomotive], allowing item but no fluid transport. With the improved [color=orange]advanced steam locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-advanced-locomotive] you can transport fluids as well. Both of these trains are fueled by burnable fuel, such as coal. However later on [color=brown]diesel fuel[/color] [item=ei-diesel-fuel-unit] is needed to power the better [color=orange] diesel locomotives[/color] [item=locomotive].

spidertron=Spidertron changes
spidertron-text=Compared to vanilla spidertron is available early in the computer age. However fuel is needed to power the vehicle. Burnable fuels are a solid choice in the beginning, but later on nuclear or fusion based fuels yield good speed and acceleration bonuses onto the spidertron. In addition mods like [color=green]Spidertron Patrols[/color] and [color=green]Constructron-Continued[/color] have special integration following the spidertron changes.

cranes-and-belts=New belts and inserter cranes
cranes-and-belts-text=Exotic Industries introduces a new tier of belts, called the [color=orange]neo logistic belt[/color] [item=ei-neo-belt] made from hightech materials with 90 items/s throughput. In addition new big inserters called [color=orange]cranes [/color] [item=ei-big-inserter] are added by the mod. They can be used to unload trains at high speeds or transfer items between chests/warehouses. 

bots=More bots
bots-text=If you're playing with the Exotic Industries Bots mod you will also have access to specialised and superior robots as well as a new roboport.


new-mechanics=New gameplay mechanics
new-mechanics-text=Exotic Industries introduces a lot of new mechanics. These mechanics are divided into several subcategories. You can find them in the menu on the left.

beacon-overhaul=Beacon overhaul
beacon-overhaul-text=Exotic Industries limits how many beacons can simultaneously affect a machine to 4 beacons at max. In addition to that beacons now require cooling fluid to run. However they can hold more modules and an improved beacon is added that counts as 2 beacons towards the limit but can hold even more modules.

specialised-pipes=Specialised pipes and data cables
specialised-pipes-text=Exotic Industries introduces specialised pipes and data cables. [color=orange]Insulated pipes[/color] are used to transport very cold fluids [fluid=ei-liquid-oxygen][fluid=ei-liquid-nitrogen] or very hot [fluid=ei-heated-helium-3] in order to keep them in their liquid phase, as in normal pipes these fluids will turn into their gas versions. [color=orange]Data cables[/color] are used to transport data between machines. They are needed to run the new [color=orange]computer[/color] [item=ei-computer-core] and [color=orange]quantum computer[/color] [item=ei-quantum-computer] machines.

space-destinations=Space destinations
space-destinations-text=The [color=orange]rocket silo[/color] [item=rocket-silo] can be used to send its cargo to different destinations. When it first gets unlocked in the computer age you will only be able to send satellites into [color=green]nauvis orbit[/color]. Depending on the type of sent satellite or rocket cargo you can then receive data or other useful launch products.

space-destinations-2=Different destinations
space-destinations-2-text=As you progress, various destinations in and away from your native solar system will become available. Depending on the distance to the selected destination you will need more or less rocket fuel. Additionally some destinations need to be uncovered first, either by sending a specialised [color=orange]exploration satellite[/color] [item=ei-exploration-satellite] or by chance when sending a rocket with normal cargo. Some new destinations might be located in deep space, [color=purple]out of the solar system[/color]. Note that even when sending exploration satellites uncovering new destinations always depends on chance.  

induction-matrix=Induction matrix
induction-matrix-text=The [color=orange]induction matrix[/color] is a compound machine that can be used to store large amounts of energy. It can be used to store overhead power just like normal accumulators and then release it later on. Different tiers of matrix size can be unlocked by researching the corresponding technologies.

induction-matrix-2=Induction matrix components
induction-matrix-2-text=The induction matrix is made up of several components. The [color=orange]Induction matrix core[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-core] is the main component of the matrix. [color=orange]Induction coils[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-coil] store energy. They can be upgraded to higher tiers and receive a bonus when placed near a [color=orange]matrix solenoid[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-solenoid]. These solenoids are more effective when placed in series, but don't overbuild them. [color=orange]Converters[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-converter] increase the volume of power that can be transferred in and out of the matrix.

exotic-stabilizers=Exotic matter stabilizers
exotic-stabilizers-text=Exotic matter is very difficult to process. It needs a specialised machine that can withstand its high energy levels. This machine is called the [color=orange]exotic matter assembler [/color] [item=ei-exotic-assembler]. However even these machines are unstable occasionally and might explode. To prevent this from happening you can place [color=orange]exotic matter stabilizers [/color] [item=ei-matter-stabilizer] around the assembler. Maybe you can even find some in the world.

black-hole=Black hole generator
black-hole-text=The mighty [color=orange]Black hole generator[/color] is a machine capable of harnessing the energy of matter itself. Building this machine and getting it into a [color=green]fully operational[/color] state wins the game. To get this reactor working you will need a good amount of building materials, a steady supply of consumable matter and a lot of power. Therefore consider having a good [color=orange]Fusion reactor[/color] infrastructure or some high end [color=orange]Induction matrices[/color] setup beforehand.

black-hole-2=Reactor components
black-hole-2-text=Multiple components make up the generator structure. The [color=orange]Black hole generator[/color] [item=ei-black-hole] is the main building needed, it will consume any item in its inventory once activated and add them to its internal [color=green]mass count[/color]. Mass inside the black hole decays over time. Here the type of item does not matter, every item yields the same mass addition. [color=orange]Energy injector pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] help in keeping the containment field of the black hole active. Each pylon consumes 5GW of power to be active, however pylons are not needed in the startup stage as the black hole is still small and can be contained by the reactor vessel itself. [color=orange] Energy extractor pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] can extract up to 100GW per pylon from the generator. Only in the fully operational stage of the black hole this is possible.

black-hole-3=Black hole stages
black-hole-3-text=Getting the reactor to work requires different steps. In the startup state no pylons are required, only an initial mass count of [color=blue]10x10^3 kg[/color] must be reached. Upon reaching 100% stage progress the generator reaches the next state. To progress further now [color=blue]8 active injector pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] must be active at anytime. Pressing the expansion button initiates an increase in the black hole radius. Over [color=blue]60s[/color] the reactor must run in this state to get into its fully operational stage. From here on [color=orange]Energy extractor pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] in range can extract energy from the machine and provide it to your grid. As the power output is massive the generator should now be mostly self sufficient, only needing an constant input of mass. 

nuclear-fission-and-fusion=Nuclear fission and fusion
nuclear-fission-and-fusion-text=Exotic Industries introduces some new features for nuclear power. These features are divided into several subcategories. You can find them in the menu on the left.

fission-reactors=Nuclear fission changes
fission-reactors-text=Nuclear fission energy is changed in this mod. The [color=orange]nuclear reactor[/color] [item=nuclear-reactor] no longer receives a neighbor bonus and has increased energy output. Uranium is harder to obtain compared to vanilla. Recycling of burnt fuel cells allows reuse of fission products in new fuel cells for increased efficiency. [color=brown]Nuclear waste[/color] [item=ei-nuclear-waste] needs to be dealt with.

fission-reactors-2=High temperature fission
fission-reactors-2-text=The [color=orange]high temperature nuclear reactor[/color] [item=ei-high-temperature-reactor] is a new fission reactor that can be used to generate even more energy. When heated up to its working temperature and supplied with extremely large quantities of water plus a fuel rod, it produces large amounts of steam more efficiently than heat exchangers. It can even use the otherwise non-fissile [color=brown]thorium[/color] [item=ei-thorium-232-fuel] fuel.

fusion-power=Fusion power
fusion-power-text=The [color=orange]fusion reactor[/color] [item=ei-fusion-reactor] is a new machine that can be used to generate large amounts of energy by fusing light atoms together. It is cooled by a [color=orange]lead coolant[/color] [fluid=ei-cold-coolant][fluid=ei-hot-coolant] cycle. However this reactor is rather expensive to build and needs a constant input of fuel. At the beginning the best fuel options are [color=blue]lithium[/color]and [color=blue]protium[/color]. Later on you can also use [color=blue]deuterium[/color] and [color=blue]tritium[/color] as fuel or even [color=blue]helium-3[/color].

fusion-power-2=Neutrons and you
fusion-power-2-text=In order to acquire the improved fusion fuels [color=green]neutrons[/color] can be used. They are produced by [color=green]nuclear fission[/color] and [color=green]fusion[/color] neutron sources and need to be captured using [color=orange]neutron collectors[/color] [item=ei-neutron-collector]. Depending on the intensity of the neutron source and distance to the collector you will get more or less neutrons.
