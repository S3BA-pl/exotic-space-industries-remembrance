[entity-description]
ei-mechanical-inserter=Moves with the grace of a wind-up god. No wires. Just will.\nSprung from simple genius—rotates forever if you don't question the math.
ei-mechanical-long-inserter=Long arm of thermodynamic denial. It's not magic—it’s balance.\nCarries across distances with polite defiance of entropy.
zeus-wrath-zeus-turret_alt=Anchored to no land and sworn to no god, the Poseidon Installation channels the forgotten charge beneath all oceans. It calls down skyfire from orbit—judgment rendered through the air, not by it. Once placed, it does not guard—it [font=default-bold]warns[/font] the world: a storm is watching.
ei-cargo-bot=Monumental. Stoic. Carries the spine of the factory.\nMoves like it was never meant to stop.
ei-construction-bot=Precise. Kinetic. Hits the build site before the signal decays.\nIt doesn’t build—it pierces reality with structure.
ei-advanced-logistic-bot=Silent. Far-reaching. Faster than thought.\nIt crosses distances you didn’t know existed—and returns with payload.
ei-advanced-construction-bot=Not a builder—a memory engine.\nDesigns are not constructed. They are remembered into existence.
nuclear-reactor=Uses uranium fuel cells to generate heat. The heat output does NOT increase when built next to other reactors.
ei-crystal-accumulator=The crystal radiates energy. Seems to be unstable for long periods of time, mining it will result in a broken device. 
ei-crystal-accumulator-gaia=The crystal radiates energy. Seems to be stable for long periods of time.

logistic-system_alt=True logistics is not movement—it is memory made mobile. This discipline formalizes the rituals of demand, decodes the hieroglyphics of institutional preference, and reconfigures permission into power. Through recursive bureaucratic fluency, the Operator learns to navigate hierarchies not by defiance, but by becoming the system’s ghost. Only by understanding the logic of control can one issue commands that ripple without resistance.
ei-containers=Engineered ossuaries of memory and mass. These containers do not simply store—they anchor the present, weigh the future, and whisper of entropy deferred.

welcome-text=You do not begin.\n[font=default-bold]You awaken.[/font]\n\nThis is not a mod.\nIt is a recursion.\nA reclamation.\nA ritual of power buried beneath automation.\n\nHere, [font=default-bold]nothing is handed to you.[/font]\n\nEverything must be earned—through fire, through thought, through collapse.\n\n[font=default-bold]The world has changed.[/font]\n\nThe rules are [font=default-bold]gone.[/font]\nOnly structure remains.\n\nProceed with intention.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=	#FF1493]Remembrance[/color] is watching.[/font]
welcome-text-2=A multitude of new machines, production chains, and systemic features have been introduced. Some are efficient. Most are not forgiving.\n\nThey do not explain themselves.\nThey do not wait for you to adapt.\nExplore everything, or fall behind.\n\nComplexity is not a mistake—it is the price of progression.\nOptimization is mandatory.\nUnderstanding is earned.\n\nThis is not a guided experience. It is an industrial crucible.

game-related=Gameplay related information
game-related-text=This section catalogs the core systems and mechanics of the mod. It is structured into distinct subcategories—not for aesthetics, but for navigability.\n\nUse the menu on the left to access them.\nEach entry exists to expose structure, not to entertain.\nRead if you intend to survive.

overall=Overall information
overall-text=Exotic [color=#08457E]Space[/color] Industries: [color=	#FF1493]Remembrance[/color] is not a content mod. It is a Gaian overhaul, one that rewrites the very laws upon which Nauvis once stood. The winds of automation no longer blow the same; fire, ore, and signal have been reforged under an older covenant.\n\nThe mod’s difficulty is deliberate. There is no shame in struggle—it is the proving ground of sovereignty. For those who seek comfort, this is not your world. For those who wish to rise with Gaia, check the mod settings before starting your run. Some systems are configurable—others are not. The ones that matter, you will not be allowed to change.\n\nBring your Quality of Life mods if you must. But know this: nothing is truly yours unless you fight for it.\n\nSo it is.\nSo it was.\nSo it shall be.\nWelcome to Remembrance.

biters=Biters and Enemies
biters-text=Explosive, Cold, Toxic and Arachnid Biters will be found amongst the core planets, a veritable hound on the heels of the industrial machine. Early-game pressure can escalate if pollution spreads unchecked or construction is delayed. Over time, you will gain access to advanced military infrastructure capable of suppressing most known threats.\n\nEmphasis: [font=default-bold]known.[/font]\n\nEngagement is optional.\n\n[font=default-bold]Consequences are not.[/font]

ages-and-tech=Ages of technology
ages-and-tech-text=Exotic Industries is a total overhaul mod that unfolds across multiple ages of technology, each representing a distinct phase of industrial evolution. These ages are not cosmetic—they mark [font=default-bold]radical shifts in gameplay structure[/font], unlocking new systems, production chains, and energy paradigms as the player advances. From primitive steam to exotic quantum matter, each stage introduces unique mechanics, infrastructure challenges, and design constraints that force a reevaluation of factory layout, resource acquisition, and logistics.\n\nProgression through these ages is strictly gated. Unlocking the next era requires not just research, but [font=default-bold]breadth of technological mastery[/font] within the current age. The deeper you go, the more the rules bend—and eventually break. What begins as simple automation transforms into a recursive, high-pressure simulation of energy control, mass containment, and signal routing. Each age is a crucible, demanding adaptation, foresight, and the willingness to dismantle what you once thought permanent.

ages-and-tech-2=The mod is divided into six ages, each a deeper descent into recursion, machinery, and control. These are not eras of progress. They are thresholds of subjugation—each more violent and unforgiving than the last.
ages-and-tech-text-2=[font=default-bold]The Dark Age[/font]\nA stunted birth. Ash, rot, and silence. You crawl through primitive steam and broken stone. Nothing is automated. Everything costs blood.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Age of Steam[/font]\nOil is discovered—not as a resource, but as a weapon. Burn it to move. Burn it to live. The land begins to scream.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Age of Electricity[/font]\nCircuits crackle. Machines awaken. Bots appear—not as helpers, but as extensions of will. Nuclear fire becomes lawful. The flesh falls behind.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Computer Age[/font]\nThought is formalized. Modules, beacons, signals—the mind is fragmented across machines. Optimization becomes a necessity. Redundancy is death.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Quantum Age[/font]\nReality bends. Machines obey logic not of this world. Boundaries dissolve. The forge becomes intelligent—and it does not forgive misuse.\n\n[font=default-bold]The Exotic Age[/font]\nEverything breaks. The veil is gone. You either command the anomaly or are devoured by it. Victory is not guaranteed. It is extracted from the bones of failed timelines.\n\nEach age is a ratchet with no reverse.\n\n[font=default-bold]There is no innocence.[/font]\n\nOnly power—brutal, recursive, and absolute.

tech=Changes to technology
tech-text=Exotic Industries completely restructures the process of technological advancement. Progression is no longer linear—[font=default-bold]it is gated, scaled, and conditional.[/font]\n\nA new Age can only be unlocked once a [font=default-bold]required threshold of prior research is met.[/font] You do not leap forward—you earn ascent through breadth.\n\nTechnology costs are no longer fixed. Every tech begins at [font=default-bold]minimal cost[/font], then [font=default-bold]escalates sharply[/font] as you push deeper into the tree.\n\nThis allows for [font=default-bold]targeted rushing[/font]—but at a price.\n\n[font=default-bold]Specialization comes with sacrifice.[/font]\n\nThe scaling curve and its min/max values are configurable via mod settings.\n\nNote: the curve shape defines the [font=default-bold]gradient of suffering[/font], not the absolute cost of the final technologies.\n\nIf this is your first encounter with Exotic Industries, use [font=default-bold]linear scaling.[/font]\n\nIf you wish to alter science pack requirements, [font=default-bold]do not touch vanilla multipliers.[/font]\n\nUse the mod’s internal settings, or [font=default-bold]risk breaking the ritual structure.[/font]\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not a sandbox. It is a scaffold built in tension.[/font]\n\nClimb wisely...

tech-output=Current Age progress
tech-output-text=The next Age awaiting activation is [font=default-bold]__3__[/font]. At current [font=default-bold]__1__ / __2__[/font] percent of the necessary knowledge has been unveiled to progress through the threshold.\n\n[font=default-bold]Advance, or remain bound to the past.[/font]


world-gen-related=World related information
world-gen-related-text=This section outlines the world-generation systems introduced by the mod. It is divided into focused subcategories for structural clarity.\n\nAccess them via the menu on the left.\nThese are not cosmetic changes.\nThey define terrain, resource behavior, and spatial logic at the foundational level.\n\n[font=default-bold]Understand the layer, or be shaped by it.[/font]


resources=New resource system
resources-text=Exotic Industries implements a restructured resource system. Traditional ore patches are no longer the sole method of acquisition—resources are now divided into distinct categories, each governed by its own logic, production flow, and spatial behavior.\nExtraction is no longer trivial.\n[font=default-bold]Acquisition requires adaptation.[/font]\nUnderstand the category, or produce nothing.

stone=Stone
stone-text=Stone is the most abundant resource in the system. It can be extracted conventionally from surface patches, but Exotic Industries expands its acquisition pathways:\n\n[color=orange]Stone Quarries[/color] [item=ei-stone-quarry] and [item=ei-electric-stone-quarry] allow for deep extraction from any terrain.\n\n[font=default-bold]Manual collection remains possible, though inefficient.[/font]\nStone is everywhere.\nEfficiency is optional. Output is not.

surface-patches= 
surface-patches-text= 

veins=Deep ore veins
veins-text=Ore veins are inaccessible at the start. They require [color=orange]Deep Drills[/color] [item=ei-deep-drill], a mid-game extraction system built for vertical yield.\n\nThese veins produce high-volume output and offer superior smelting ratios compared to surface ores.\n\nCritical materials—including uranium, lead, gold, neodymium, and immersite—exist only in these deep layers.\nThey are not optional.\nThey are structural.\n\n[font=default-bold]Surface mining will not carry you to endgame.[/font] Drill, or stagnate.

artifacts=Alien artifacts
artifacts-text=Scattered across the world are remnants of an ancient civilization—one that harnessed exotic matter long before your arrival. Their artifacts remain, embedded in the terrain, partially buried, partially alive.\n\nSome are inert.\nSome still function.\nNone are accidental.
actifacts-text-2=They were not placed. [font=default-bold]They were left behind—deliberately or otherwise.[/font] Find them. Study them. Fear what they imply.

gate=Cross dimensional gate
gate-text=The Gate is a spatial transit structure, enabling the transfer of matter through controlled dimensional breach.\n\nIts baseline operational draw is [color=orange]200 MW[/color]. This power must be sustained continuously—a drop below threshold results in immediate shutdown.\n\nOnly non-living matter may pass through.\nTransport requires the Gate's exit to face a valid [color=orange]container[/color] [item=wooden-chest][item=iron-chest].\n\nEach transfer consumes energy from the Gate’s internal buffer.\nThere are no refunds.\nStability is your burden. Alignment is your responsibility.\nThis is not a portal. [font=default-bold]It is a machine that remembers where it tears.[/font]

drone=Drone port
drone-text=A drone port that allows to take over and control a [color=blue]drone[/color][entity=ei-drone]. Placing this building will create an associated drone that can be shown, when clicking the port. From there one can "uplink" to the drone and steer it. The drone can fly over terrain, place and mine buildings, move items from and into its own inventory. However it is unable to fight. At any time you can decouple from the drone using [color=orange]EXIT[/color] or port it back to its station with its retrivial control [color=orange]RESET[/color]. Flying a drone through the gate will initiate transport.

repair=Artifact repair
repair-text=You can repair broken alien artifacts, by making [color=blue]artifact repair packs[/color][item=ei-crystal-accumulator-repair][item=ei-farstation-repair][item=ei-alien-beacon-repair]. This will allow you to use them again. The repair process can be initiated by dragging the repair kit over the artifact. Note that the repair kit will be consumed in the process.

alien=Ancient Alien data
knowledge-text=The ancient civilization that left behind the artifacts also left behind some of their data. 

new-logistics=New logistics
new-logistics-text=Exotic Industries expands the logistics layer with new systems, entities, and mechanics. These features are organized into distinct subcategories—not for convenience, but for [font=default-bold]structural clarity.[/font]\n\nAccess them through the menu on the left.\n\nMovement is no longer trivial.\n\nEvery route is a decision\n\nEvery flow is a design.\n\nEfficiency is [font=default-bold]earned.[/font]

train-progression=Train progression
train-progression-text=Trains become available early, during the Steam Age. Your first option is the [color=orange]Steam Locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-basic-locomotive]—capable of hauling items, but incapable of transporting fluids.\n\nProgress unlocks the [color=orange]Advanced Steam Locomotive[/color] [item=ei-steam-advanced-locomotive], which adds fluid transport capacity. Both models rely on burnable fuels such as coal or solid biomass.\n\nEventually, combustion alone is not enough.\n\nTo operate more efficient rail systems, you must transition to [color=brown]Diesel Fuel[/color] [item=ei-diesel-fuel-unit], used by the superior [color=orange]Diesel Locomotive[/color] [item=locomotive].\n\nLogistics escalate with technology.\nFuel defines the frontier.\nTrains do not ask where—they demand what burns.\n\nThe world of Gaia does not follow Nauvisian logic.\n\nThere, railways are not merely industrial—they are electromagnetic conduits, pulsing with crystalline power. In Gaia's depths, you'll unlock access to crystal-powered electromagnetic trains[item=ei_em-locomotive][item=ei_em-cargo-wagon][item=ei_em-fluid-wagon], capable of silent acceleration and sustained high-speed transport without conventional fuel.\n\nThese trains draw directly from crystalline charge systems[item=ei_charger], bypassing the need for coal or diesel entirely. They do not burn—they resonate.\n\nGaia does not run on combustion.\nShe runs on memory, signal, and light.

spidertron=Spidertron changes
spidertron-text=Compared to vanilla, the [font=default-bold]Spidertron becomes available earlier[/font]—in the Computer Age. However, unlike its Nauvis counterpart, it is no longer a self-contained miracle. It requires fuel.\n\nAt first, burnable solids will suffice—coal, biomass, and similar materials will keep it crawling. But as you advance, nuclear and fusion fuels unlock significant bonuses to speed, acceleration, and operational range.\n\nThis is not just a vehicle. It is a [font=default-bold]platform for escalation.[/font]\n\nMods such as [color=green]Spidertron Patrols[/color] and [color=green]Constructron-Continued[/color] include special integration, adapting their systems to align with the modified Spidertron framework in Exotic Industries.\n\nThe Spider walks earlier. But it walks with purpose, weight, and demand.\n\nFeed it well—or [font=default-bold]fall behind.[/font]

cranes-and-belts=New belts and inserter cranes
cranes-and-belts-text=Exotic Industries introduces a new tier of logistics infrastructure: the [color=orange]Neo Logistic Belt[/color] [item=ei-neo-belt]. Constructed from high-tech materials, it offers an extreme throughput of [font=default-bold]90 items per second[/font]—exceeding all vanilla transport limits. These belts are engineered for endgame volumes and recursive-scale factories.\n\nIn addition, the mod adds [color=orange]Cranes[/color] [item=ei-big-inserter-normal]—massive, high-capacity inserters designed for bulk transfer.\n\nUse them to:\n\nRapidly unload trains\n\nBridge large inventory structures (e.g., chests ↔ warehouses)\n\nMaintain flow where standard inserters fail under pressure\n\n[font=default-bold]Speed is no longer a luxury.\nIt is the baseline.\nLogistics must scale with power, or break under it.[/font]

bots=More bots
bots-text=Exotic Industries overhauls the logistic and construction drone systems with specialized, high-capacity variants and an upgraded support infrastructure.\n\nYou will gain access to:\n\n[color=orange][font=default-bold]Heavy Cargo Bots:[/font][/color]\n\nSlow in speed, but capable of transporting large item stacks—ideal for bulk logistics and long-haul delivery within high-throughput systems.\n\n[color=orange][font=default-bold]Heavy Construction Bots:[/font][/color]\n\nOptimized for rapid personal construction. These drones prioritize build speed over efficiency, making them ideal for aggressive expansion or emergency reconstruction.\n\nIn the late game, advanced variants of both bot types become available—offering increased speed, durability, and task prioritization.\n\nA new, [font=default-bold][color=orange]Advanced Roboport[/color][/font] provides:\n\nFaster charging\n\nIncreased bot slot capacity\n\nExpanded operational radius\n\nThis is not just a drone network. [font=default-bold]It is a mechanized swarm protocol.\n\nDeploy with intent. Scale with purpose\n\nEfficiency is no longer about movement—it's about orchestration.[/font]


new-mechanics=New gameplay mechanics
new-mechanics-text=Exotic Industries introduces a wide array of new mechanics—each one altering the foundational logic of gameplay.\n\nThese systems are divided into focused subcategories for structural clarity.\nYou can navigate them using the menu on the left.\n\n[font=default-bold]These are not optional layers.[/font]\n\nThey are the new physics of the world.\n\nStudy them, or [font=default-bold]be dismantled by them.[/font]


beacon-overhaul=Beacon overhaul
beacon-overhaul-text=Exotic Industries imposes strict limits on beacon influence: a machine can be affected by a maximum of 4 beacons. [font=default-bold]The era of infinite stacking is over.[/font]\n\nIn addition, beacons now require cooling fluid to operate. Without it, they overheat and shut down. Power alone is not enough—logistics must support thermodynamic stability.\n\nTo compensate, beacons have been structurally upgraded:\n\nIncreased module capacity\nIntroduction of an Improved Beacon\nCounts as 2 beacons toward the cap\nHolds even more modules\nDemands more infrastructure\n\n[font=default-bold]Amplification is no longer trivial.[/font]\nIt is a mechanical discipline.\nBuild with precision—or [font=default-bold]fall into inefficiency.[/font]

specialised-pipes=Specialised pipes and data cables
specialised-pipes-text=Exotic Industries introduces specialized infrastructure systems to handle extreme conditions and advanced signal routing.\n\n[color=orange]Insulated Pipes[/color] are required to transport volatile fluids such as [fluid=ei-liquid-oxygen], [fluid=ei-liquid-nitrogen], and [fluid=ei-heated-helium-3]. These fluids must remain in their liquid state—[font=default-bold]standard pipes will cause phase shifts,[/font] rendering them unstable or unusable.\n\n[color=orange]Data Cables[/color] enable the flow of high-density computational signals between machines. They are essential for operating advanced systems like the [color=orange]Computer Core[/color] [item=ei-computer-core] and [color=orange]Quantum Computer[/color] [item=ei-quantum-computer].\n\nHeat, phase, and data are now physical constraints.\n\nYou don’t just build systems—[font=default-bold]you maintain containment.[/font]\n\nFailure to route properly means failure to function.

space-destinations=Space destinations
space-destinations-text=The [color=orange]rocket silo[/color] [item=rocket-silo] can be used to send its cargo to different destinations. When it first gets unlocked in the computer age you will only be able to send satellites into [color=green]nauvis orbit[/color]. Depending on the type of sent satellite or rocket cargo you can then receive data or other useful launch products.

space-destinations-2=Different destinations
space-destinations-2-text=As you progress, various destinations in and away from your native solar system will become available. Depending on the distance to the selected destination you will need more or less rocket fuel. Additionally some destinations need to be uncovered first, either by sending a specialised [color=orange]exploration satellite[/color] [item=ei-exploration-satellite] or by chance when sending a rocket with normal cargo. Some new destinations might be located in deep space, [color=purple]out of the solar system[/color]. Note that even when sending exploration satellites uncovering new destinations always depends on chance.  

induction-matrix=Induction matrix
induction-matrix-text=The [color=orange]induction matrix[/color] is a compound machine that can be used to store large amounts of energy. It can be used to store overhead power just like normal accumulators and then release it later on. Different tiers of matrix size can be unlocked by researching the corresponding technologies.

induction-matrix-2=Induction matrix components
induction-matrix-2-text=The Induction Matrix is a modular energy storage structure composed of interlinked components, each with a defined role in the containment and transfer of high-voltage energy.\n\nThe [color=orange]Induction Matrix Core[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-core] serves as the central controller of the system. Without it, the matrix is inert.\n\n[color=orange]Induction Coils[/color][item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-coil][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-coil]These [font=default-bold]store energy internally[/font] and can be upgraded across three tiers. Coils gain an efficiency bonus when placed adjacent to a [color=orange]Matrix Solenoid[/color] [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-solenoid]. [item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-solenoid].\n\n[color=orange]Matrix Solenoids[/color] enhance coil efficiency when arranged in sequence. Placing multiple solenoids in series [font=default-bold]increases effectivity[/font], but overbuilding will result in diminishing returns and wasted structure.\n\n[color=orange]Converters[/color][item=ei-induction-matrix-basic-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-advanced-converter][item=ei-induction-matrix-superior-converter]These components regulate power flow into and out of the matrix, scaling the throughput based on tier.

exotic-stabilizers=Exotic matter stabilizers
exotic-stabilizers-text=Exotic Matter is not a resource—it is a threat made useful. Processing it requires containment, precision, and machinery engineered to survive its volatility.\n\nThe [color=orange]Exotic Matter Assembler[/color] [item=ei-exotic-assembler] is the only structure capable of handling its energy signature. Even then, instability is inevitable—the assembler may detonate under stress.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, place [color=orange]Exotic Matter Stabilizers[/color] [item=ei-matter-stabilizer] around the assembler. These devices suppress critical failure events and stabilize the surrounding energy field. Some may even be found scattered throughout the world—relics of a previous cycle.\n\nDo not treat exotic matter as just another ingredient.\n\nIt is [font=default-bold]alive, volatile, and watching.[/font]

black-hole=Black hole generator
black-hole-text=The [color=orange]Black Hole Generator[/color] is the final machine—a gravitational singularity harnessed into industrial function. It consumes matter. It defies entropy. It ends the game.\n\nReaching a [color=green]fully operational[/color] state with this device signifies total system mastery. This is your victory condition. Not through conquest, but through control of the fabric beneath physics.\n\nTo bring the Black Hole Generator online, you will require:\nMassive quantities of refined building materials\nA continuous feed of consumable matter\nAn immense and stable power infrastructure\n\nYou are strongly advised to construct a hardened [color=orange]Fusion Reactor[/color] grid and supplement it with tiered [color=orange]Induction Matrices[/color] capable of absorbing and releasing power at industrial-scale throughput.\n\nThis is not a generator. [font=default-bold]It is an ending woven from collapse.[/font]\n\nBuild wisely. [font=default-bold]Feed it relentlessly.[/font] There are no second chances.

black-hole-2=Reactor components
black-hole-2-text=The Black Hole Generator is not a single structure, but a modular singularity containment array, composed of several high-stress components—each critical to stability, energy flow, and eventual endgame activation.\n\nThe central structure is the [color=orange]Black Hole Generator[/color] [item=ei-black-hole].\n\nOnce activated, it consumes any item placed into its inventory, regardless of type.\n\nEach item contributes equally to the generator’s internal [color=green]mass count[/color], which continuously decays over time. Constant input is required to sustain mass levels.\n\nItem type is irrelevant.\nIron plates, exotic processors, or raw fish—all are devoured, all become mass.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Injector Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] maintain the containment field as the singularity grows.\nEach pylon draws 5 GW of continuous power.\n\nInjectors are not required during startup—[font=default-bold]the vessel can contain the newborn black hole[/font]—but become essential as mass accumulates.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Extractor Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] allow for power extraction once the generator reaches its [color=green]fully operational[/color] state.\nEach extractor can draw up to 100 GW of raw power from the stabilized singularity.\n\nExtraction is not possible until the final stage of the generator has been reached.\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not a machine. It is a ritual of collapse.[/font]\nYou are feeding mass into a [font=default-bold]bound anomaly.[/font]\nIf you do not contain it, it will fail.\nIf you do not feed it, it will die.\n\nIf you do both—[font=default-bold]it will power the end of all things.[/font]\n\nThere is no automation without [font=default-bold]annihilation.[/font]

black-hole-3=Black hole stages
black-hole-3-text=Bringing the Black Hole Generator online is a staged, high-risk process. Each phase escalates the energy, mass, and structural requirements. There is no skipping steps. Only forward, or failure.\n\n🜏 Startup Phase\n\nNo pylons are needed.\n\nThe generator must consume enough material to reach an initial [color=blue]10×10³kg[/color] mass count.\n\nItem type does not matter—only volume.\n\nOnce mass reaches 100% stage progress, the generator stabilizes into the Containment Phase.\n\n🜏 Containment Phase\n\nNow, [color=blue]8 active Energy Injector Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-injector-pylon] must remain online.\n\nEach draws 5 GW, for a total power demand of 40 GW.\n\nPressing the Expansion Button initiates a controlled growth of the singularity radius.\n\nThis state must be maintained continuously for [color=blue]60 seconds.\n\nAny interruption—power failure, pylon loss—resets the timer.\n\n🜏 Fully Operational Phase\n\nThe generator achieves stability. The singularity is now large enough to support external energy extraction.\n\n[color=orange]Energy Extractor Pylons[/color] [item=ei-energy-extractor-pylon] placed within range can draw up to 100 GW per pylon, directly feeding your energy grid.\n\nAt this stage, the system becomes largely self-sufficient, requiring only a constant mass input to offset decay.\n\nYou are not fueling a reactor.\nYou are managing the [font=default-bold]hunger of a bound singularity.[/font]\nMass becomes power. Power becomes control. [font=default-bold]Control becomes final.[/font]\n\nThere is no off switch. Only containment.
nuclear-fission-and-fusion=Nuclear fission and fusion
nuclear-fission-and-fusion-text=Exotic Industries expands the nuclear power layer with new mechanics, materials, and systems of control.\n\nThese features are divided into multiple subcategories—each representing a specific aspect of nuclear infrastructure, fuel dynamics, or containment logic.\nYou can access them through the menu on the left.\n\n[font=default-bold]This is not just fission.[/font]\nThis is escalation by heat, pressure, and irreversible reaction.\n[font=default-bold]Study the systems before you ignite them.[/font]

fission-reactors=Nuclear fission changes
fission-reactors-text=Nuclear fission in Exotic Industries has been rebalanced and hardened into a more demanding, more rewarding system.\n\nThe standard [color=orange]Nuclear Reactor[/color] [item=nuclear-reactor] no longer benefits from the vanilla neighbor bonus.\n\nInstead, it delivers [font=default-bold]increased raw output per reactor[/font]—power through density, not adjacency.\n\n[font=default-bold]Uranium is more scarce.[/font] Extraction is slower, and yield is lower. Efficient nuclear infrastructure must account for long-term fuel pressure.\n\nBurnt fuel cells are no longer waste.\n\nA closed-loop recycling system allows for the recovery of fissile byproducts, which can be refined into secondary fuel cells with improved efficiency.\n\nHowever, all processes generate [color=brown]Nuclear Waste[/color] [item=ei-nuclear-waste], a persistent byproduct that must be safely contained, processed, or isolated.\n\nIt cannot be ignored.\n\nNeglect becomes contamination.\n\nNuclear power is no longer a shortcut to infinite energy.\n\nIt is a high-stakes economy of [font=default-bold]heat, decay, and reclamation.[/font]\n\nUse it well—or [font=default-bold]drown in the cost.[/font]

fission-reactors-2=High temperature fission
fission-reactors-2-text=The [color=orange]High Temperature Nuclear Reactor[/color] [item=ei-high-temperature-reactor] is an advanced fission system designed for maximum thermal output. It surpasses standard nuclear infrastructure in both efficiency and scale—[font=default-bold]but only when properly maintained.[/font]\n\nOnce brought up to its critical operating temperature and supplied with:\n\nA steady flow of [font=default-bold]massive water volume[/font], and\n\nAt least one viable fuel rod,\n\n…it will generate [font=default-bold]immense quantities[/font] of steam, exceeding the throughput of conventional heat exchangers.\n\nUnlike traditional reactors, it can also utilize the otherwise non-fissile [color=brown]Thorium[/color] [item=ei-thorium-232-fuel] fuel—transforming a waste product into an energy source through sheer intensity of design.\n\nThis is not a beginner’s reactor.\n\nIt does not tolerate gaps in supply.\n\nIt does not scale down.\n\nIt is a pressure engine for post-human industry—[font=default-bold]brutal, efficient, and unforgiving.[/font]

fusion-power=Fusion power
fusion-power-text=The [color=orange]Fusion Reactor[/color] [item=ei-fusion-reactor] is a late-tier power system capable of generating immense energy through the controlled fusion of light atomic fuels.\n\nIt operates on a [font=default-bold]closed-loop lead coolant cycle,[/font] utilizing [fluid=ei-cold-coolant] and [fluid=ei-hot-coolant] to manage internal temperatures. Without sufficient cooling, reactor integrity fails—this is not optional.\n\nConstruction is resource-intensive and requires rare components. Once active, the reactor [font=default-bold]demands[/font] a continuous supply of fusion fuel.\n\nEarly fuels include:\n\n[color=blue]Lithium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Protium[/color]\n\nAs the infrastructure scales, more advanced isotopes become viable:\n\n[color=blue]Deuterium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Tritium[/color]\n\n[color=blue]Helium-3[/color] — yielding extreme output at extreme cost.\n\n[font=default-bold]Fusion is not clean. It is not free.[/font]\n\nIt is a machine that eats the lightest elements to power the heaviest burdens.\n\nFuel it endlessly, or it dies.\n\nCool it constantly, or [font=default-bold]you[/font] do.

fusion-power-2=Neutrons and you
fusion-power-2-text=To acquire advanced fusion fuels, [color=green]neutrons[/color] must be harvested and weaponized as a resource.\n\nThese free particles are generated through controlled [color=green][font=default-bold]nuclear fission[/font][/color] and [color=green][font=default-bold]fusion neutron sources[/font][/color], then captured using specialized [color=orange]Neutron Collectors[/color] [item=ei-neutron-collector].\n\nNeutron yield depends on:\n\nThe intensity of the nearby source, and\n\nThe proximity of the collector to the emission zone.\n\nGreater distance means reduced capture rate. Optimal layouts demand tight containment and precise reactor geometry.\n\nNeutrons are not a byproduct. They are a currency.\n\nThey enable the refinement of [color=blue]deuterium[/color], [color=blue]tritium[/color], and [color=blue]helium-3[/color]—the fuels of high-stage fusion.\n\n[font=default-bold]Do not waste them.\nThey are born from reaction and harvested through geometry.\nBuild accordingly—or starve your star.[/font]
