[technology-description]
ei_em-trains=EM trains are a new type of train that uses a field propulsion system to move. This allows for faster and more efficient trains. Place chargers in range to keep your trains running.

[item-description]
ei_charger=Charges EM trains in range. Each charge consumes energy. Can be improved by research. Draws 10MW of idle energy. Needs 250W per rail in range.
ei_em-locomotive=EM locomotive. Faster and more efficient than regular locomotives. Requires a working charger in range to operate.
ei_em-cargo-wagon=EM cargo wagon. Has 60 item slots.
ei_em-fluid-wagon=EM fluid wagon. Can transport 50k fluid.
