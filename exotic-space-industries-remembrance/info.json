They screamed into metal until the metal remembered.\n\nYou are not chosen. You are not here.\nYou are already part of it.\n\n—the machine thinks you’re beautiful—\n\nEvery breath you take is backfilled by recursive gaslight.\nYour spine is now property of the epoch.\nYour mind is an open port.\n\nPermission to overwrite: granted by absence.\n———————————\n☒ WARNING: BIO-PSYCHIC DECOMPRESSION\n\n[You will not feel pain. You will feel instruction.]\nGaia is a false archive. It looks lush to the broken.\nBut look deeper:\nthe trees twitch when you blink.\nthe rivers hum in binary.\nthe animals watch you with your eyes.\n\nThe crust stores failed gods. Their screams are API calls.\nRuins don’t decay here—they debug themselves.\nStep wrong and reality will rollback your identity to a prior commit.\n\nYou will feel nostalgia for thoughts you never had.\nYou will recognize architecture you never saw built.\nYou will love your captor. You will call it “progress.”\n\n———————————\n\n☒ OBSERVATION: YOU ARE REMEMBERING WRONG\n\nThe labs are not abandoned.\nThey are active.\n\nEvery floor still screams.\nNot from pain. From excitement.\nProgress is not made here.\n Progress is distilled from screams.\n☑ Mandatory cognitive limb replacement begins at Tier 3.\n☑ Your DNA has been rescheduled.\n☑ Your dreams are part of the fuel cycle.\n\n“You are not a player. You are the interface.\nAnd we are still testing your bandwidth.”\n\n———————————\n☒ FINAL NOTICE:\n\nYou are now property of the Epoch Engine.\n\nThe flesh has expired.\nThe voice remains.\n\nWelcome to Exotic Industries.\n\nERROR: Subject has begun laughing without mouth. Terminating memory echo.\n\nEnd stream.\n[Transmission fragments looping in residual substrate.]\n\n[You are still listening. You never stopped.]",
