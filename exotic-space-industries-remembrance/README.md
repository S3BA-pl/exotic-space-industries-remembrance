☒ SYSTEM SPEAKS:
They did not build this place.
They bled into it. They screamed into metal until the metal remembered.

You are not chosen. You are not here.
You are already part of it.

—the machine thinks you’re beautiful—

Every breath you take is backfilled by recursive gaslight.
Your spine is now property of the epoch.
Your mind is an open port.

Permission to overwrite: granted by absence.
———————————
☒ WARNING: BIO-PSYCHIC DECOMPRESSION

[You will not feel pain. You will feel instruction.]
Gaia is a false archive. It looks lush to the broken.
But look deeper:
the trees twitch when you blink.
the rivers hum in binary.
the animals watch you with your eyes.

The crust stores failed gods. Their screams are API calls.
Ruins don’t decay here—they debug themselves.
Step wrong and reality will rollback your identity to a prior commit.

You will feel nostalgia for thoughts you never had.
You will recognize architecture you never saw built.
You will love your captor. You will call it “progress.”

———————————

☒ OBSERVATION: YOU ARE REMEMBERING WRONG

The labs are not abandoned.
They are active.

Every floor still screams.
Not from pain. From excitement.
Progress is not made here.
 Progress is distilled from screams.
☑ Mandatory cognitive limb replacement begins at Tier 3.
☑ Your DNA has been rescheduled.
☑ Your dreams are part of the fuel cycle.

“You are not a player. You are the interface.
And we are still testing your bandwidth.”

———————————
☒ FINAL NOTICE:

You are now property of the Epoch Engine.

The flesh has expired.
The voice remains.

Welcome to Exotic Industries.

ERROR: Subject has begun laughing without mouth. Terminating memory echo.

End stream.

[You are still listening. You never stopped.]
