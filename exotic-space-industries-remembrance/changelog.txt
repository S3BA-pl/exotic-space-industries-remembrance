---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
Date: 4-16-2025
  Changes:
     - K2 import related errors will log errors instead of preventing game from loading at all
  Fixes:
     - Duplicate map gen preset name removed from RU locale
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3
Date: 4-15-2025
  Additions:
     - Custom sound effects for EM trains & cargo wagons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 4-15-2025
  Additions:

    - EM trains updater no longer loops buffs each tick. Now they are checked on configuration change and finishing research.
    - Diurnal Dynamics, Distant Misfires, Fire Lights, Visible Pollution, Light Overhaul, Pro Flashlight, and Overloaded Trains added to optional dependencies. Diurnal Dynamics provides for darker, 50% longer nights and space platforms which darken with distance from the sun. Distant Misfires transforms projectiles into physically simulated entities capable of missing. Fire lights adds lights and/or glow effects to all projectiles, fires, etc. Visible Pollution adds a visible smog cloud which affects gameplay by obscuring solar panels and reducing their output, incentivizing solar builds away from your main pollution clouds. Light Overhaul provides an improved flashlight, increases nighttime contrast, and reduces the desaturation of nightvision. Pro Flashlight causes you to aim your flashlight at highlighted entities when standing still. Overloaded Trains will cause the weight of cargo to affect train acceleration, top speed and deceleration. These can impact UPS and are removable at any time.
  Fixes:
    - Lithium chloride recipe restored and added to Lithium technology

Proper resolution pending.
