    - Fueler inventory larger and support filters
    - Ported supersonic EM-trains, with working to full extent EM trains upgrade technologies
    - Ported several Krastorio entities: steel pipe, steel pump, planetary teleporter, wind turbine, gas power station, energy storage, deitherium fusion reactor, advanced steam turbine, antimatter reactor, immersite quarry drill, small roboport, big roboport, greenhouse, electrolysis plant, filtration plant, atmospheric condenser, fluid flare stack, advanced chemical plant, quantum computer, matter plant, matter associator, stablizer charging station, air purifier, fluids, intermediates, immersite and antimatter ammo and rockets, and intergalactic transceiver
    - Rockets can lift up to 20 tons, starter pack weight 20T and create platform with 2000 foundation
    - Larger rocket silo inventory, use custom minimum payload from hub gui to deliver underfull rockets
    - Biolabs feed on nutrients instead of electricity
    - Stone brick can be crushed back to stone  
    - Large foundry fluid buffer
    - Can dump items to water tiles on Nauvis, Gleba, Aquilo as well as on Fulgora
    - Oil ocean yields crude oil
    - Artificial soil can be placed anywhere
  Notes:
    - Plans to rework rockets later with expensive but reusable carrier rockets and expendable cargo pods
    - Port more entities to place in Simulation Computer Age stage thats looks quite empty now comparing to others
    - Will balance / simplify / merge recipes and items during gameplay
    - K2 intergalactic transceiver - working, but without victory trigger, for use in scenario, that, maybe will be later
