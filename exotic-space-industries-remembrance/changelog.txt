   -K2 import related errors will log errors instead of preventing game from loading at all
  Fixes:
   -Duplicate map gen preset name removed from RU locale

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.3
Date: 4-15-25
  Additions:

   -Removed register charger debug output.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.1
Date: 4-15-25
  Additions:
    - Imported ru, zh locales from previous repository, applied pull from @astorin, now committed.. likely requires updates which will require native speaker

    - EM trains updater no longer loops buffs each tick. Now they are checked on configuration change and finishing research.
    - Diurnal Dynamics, Distant Misfires, Fire Lights, Visible Pollution, Light Overhaul, Pro Flashlight, and Overloaded Trains added to optional dependencies. Diurnal Dynamics provides for darker, 50% longer nights and space platforms which darken with distance from the sun. Distant Misfires transforms projectiles into physically simulated entities capable of missing. Fire lights adds lights and/or glow effects to all projectiles, fires, etc. Visible Pollution adds a visible smog cloud which affects gameplay by obscuring solar panels and reducing their output, incentivizing solar builds away from your main pollution clouds. Light Overhaul provides an improved flashlight, increases nighttime contrast, and reduces the desaturation of nightvision. Pro Flashlight causes you to aim your flashlight at highlighted entities when standing still. Overloaded Trains will cause the weight of cargo to affect train acceleration, top speed and deceleration. These can impact UPS and are removable at any time.
  Fixes:
    - Lithium chloride recipe restored and added to Lithium technology
    - EM train charger properly counts nearby tiles-Overlaps will double charge.
    - EM train charger no longer provides infinite energy if you power it up and then remove the electric network connection.

  Fixes:
    - Tooltips added for metalworks recipes, arc furnace, purifier, crusher, biolab.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.9
Date: 4-11-25
  Changes:
    - Loader electricity usage adjusted and now increases per tier
  Fixes:
    - Sanity check when creating insulated/data pipe from default pipe, this mitigates crashes caused by multi layered sprites. (Revealed by Muluna 1.34.2) While it will not crash, other mods changing entities to use multiple layer sprites will cause insulated/data pipe graphics to display incorrectly. Proper resolution pending.
    - Electronic components now tied to EI electronic parts technology. Reported by @Vasishtha
    - Spidertron limiter updated to use 2.0s new lua logistics commands, setting a logistic request on the spidertron will no longer cause a crash. Reported by @debuasgaming

    - Rocket lift capacity multiplier added to startup settings
    - Entity update cycle length adjustment added to startup settings. This setting determines over how many ticks the 8 entity update stages run. Default 60 ie all entities are looped once per 60 ticks ie 1 second
  Changes:
    - Loaders now require electricity and can be wired
    - Arc Furnace energy requirement 5MW -> 30MW, pollution value 0 -> 6
    - Plasma Heater energy requirement 20Mw -> 70MW, craft speed 1 -> 1.25, now accepts Quality module, pollution value 0 -> 3
    - Caster module slots 1 -> 2, now accepts Quality module, pollution value 0 -> 1
    - Skip converting Fulgora oceans into crude oil if Fulgora Extended is enabled & chemical-mire-gives-muck is enabled
  Fixes:
    - Additional checks to prevent null references in on tick updater & gate updater
    - Startup settings tooltips were configured inconsistently, tooltips should all work now
  Notes:
    - Several quick fixes have been implemented to allow the use of K2 imports, final implementations pending
